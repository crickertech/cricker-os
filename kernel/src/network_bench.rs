//! **Milestone 494 (a driver for the network card a PC actually has)'s bench boot**, behind the
//! `network_bench` feature (name provisional; notes/e1000e.md has the evening it is for).
//!
//! Exit criterion 2 asks for three things on xenon, photographed: the PCI survey line naming the
//! card, a DHCP lease from the house router, and a measured transfer from a host on the LAN. The
//! tour already prints the survey. This boot replaces the hand-over with the other two, through
//! exactly the code the QEMU gates prove (`e1000e_service`, `net_stack`, `socket_test_client`), and
//! prints them in the order they can fail, every line prefixed `network-bench:` so a photograph and
//! a serial capture read the same way:
//!
//! 1. `nic`: the device id and model, its requester id, whether the link came up, the MAC address;
//! 2. `phy`: the PHY's identifier, read over MDIO by the kernel at bring-up (`0x01410cb0` under
//!    QEMU; on an I219 the line is preceded by the bring-up's own `e1000e:` lines);
//! 3. `preflight dmar scope : PASS|FAIL`, which IOMMU unit owns the NIC, the condition milestone
//!    261 (the NVMe driver leaves the kernel)'s bench evening named for the NVMe applied to this
//!    device;
//! 4. `dhcp`: the leased address, after a line saying it is waiting, so a boot that never gets one
//!    ends on that line rather than on silence;
//! 5. `transfer`: bytes, time and rate from the peer the image was built for;
//! 6. `verdict LEASED-AND-MEASURED | UNCONFINED | NO-PEER | FAILED`, and `done, halting.`
//!
//! # What the number counts
//!
//! One TCP stream into `net_stack` through a 2 KiB socket buffer, received by a client process one
//! `RECEIVE` call per chunk, with the NIC polled every millisecond. **That is a measurement of this
//! stack as built, not of the I219**: the window is 2 KiB, so the rate is bounded by round trips
//! rather than by the wire, and the poll interval sits inside every round trip. It is the number
//! a package download gets today, which is what rung 3 needs to know.
//!
//! # On radon
//!
//! A riscv64 machine whose tree names a JH7110 Ethernet port (milestone 53 (the board's own
//! peripherals: network and storage on real silicon)) runs the same boot over
//! `designware_ethernet_service` instead, with the bring-up's own account first: the clock and
//! reset words before and after, the syscon select, the controller and PHY identities, where the
//! station address came from, both reset times, the **coherence probe's verdict** with the words it
//! was judged on, and the link. Its preflight line is `coherence`, where xenon's is `dmar scope`:
//! each is the one condition that decides whether the numbers after it mean anything on that
//! machine. notes/designware-ethernet.md has the runbook and what each ending means.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The DHCP wait has no bound.** `net_stack` retries DISCOVER forever and the kernel blocks on
//!   its report. A boot with no lease ends on the `waiting` line, which is the diagnosis.
//! - **The peer is baked into the image** at build time (`NIFE_NETWORK_BENCH_PEER`), because this
//!   boot has no way to be told one. A different peer is a rebuild.
