//! Capability revocation and untyped reclamation (milestone 13, DECISIONS §13; storage reworked
//! at milestone 14 phase C).
//!
//! Until now a granted capability could not be retracted and a spent page could not be reclaimed.
//! That was safe only by a structural accident: retyped frames are **spend-only, never reused**
//! (untyped.rs), so a peer that still mapped a shared frame after the granter left was mapping
//! valid, non-reused memory. `memory_region::destroy` carried a tripwire saying exactly this: wiring up
//! any reclamation before revocation exists turns those "harmless" dangling mappings into a
//! use-after-free.
//!
//! This module is that revocation. It keeps a **mapping database, lite**: every mapping of an
//! untyped-derived page, and since §132 the object each mapping was made under.
//!
//! # Two scopes, because two questions are being asked
//!
//! **Reclamation asks "is this page safe to hand out again", so it is object-blind.**
//! `memory_region::destroy` unmaps a page from *every* address space that held it and deletes every
//! capability whose run overlaps the range, after which no holder maps it and no capability names
//! it. Anything less is §13's use-after-free, because the allocator is about to give the memory to
//! somebody else.
//!
//! **`PageFrame::REVOKE` asks "whose authority is being taken back", so it is capability-scoped**
//! (DECISIONS §132, option C, decided 2026-08-27). It reclaims nothing (a region is spend-only), so
//! a mapping made under a *different* capability over the same physical memory is somebody else's
//! authority and survives. §102 is what made those two answers diverge: once one capability can name
//! a run, two capabilities can overlap, and the tree's display wiring has three that do.
//!
//! seL4 keeps a full capability-derivation tree and revokes a *subtree*. This keeps no tree: the
//! object address in each record stands in for one, because `derive` never changes the object, so
//! one word matches a capability and all of its derivatives.
//!
//! # Who pays for the records (phase C, the heap's last customer)
//!
//! The database used to be a global `Vec`: one entry per user mapping, growing without bound, on
//! the kernel's heap. **Now the mapper pays.** Each address space's records live in log pages
//! retyped from *its own* untyped region, reached through a fixed registry of live spaces (root,
//! region, log head). A process that maps a thousand shared pages spends its own budget recording
//! them; a process that cannot afford the record cannot make the mapping. And teardown got
//! simpler, not more complex: the log pages are region pages, so `memory_region::destroy` reclaims the
//! records with the process, and "forget this root" is one registry slot going empty.

/// starts at `object`**. `phys == 0` is a tombstone (RAM starts at `0x4000_0000` on this board, so
/// no real frame is 0).
///
/// # Why the third word exists (DECISIONS §132, option C)
///
/// Without it a revocation cannot tell *which* capability produced a mapping, so `PageFrame::REVOKE`
/// had to unmap the physical page from every space that held it, whoever mapped it and under
/// whatever authority. §102 made that visible by letting one capability name a run: the tree's own
/// display wiring has a driver holding `PageFrame(dma, 312)` and two clients holding
/// `PageFrame(dma + 4096, 311)` over the same memory, so a client's revoke reached into the
/// driver's space under a capability nobody revoked.
///
/// **The run's base address identifies the capability, derivatives included**, and that is the
/// whole reason one word is enough: `Cap::derive` narrows rights and never changes the object, so
/// matching on the object matches the entire derivation family without the §13 derivation tree this
/// kernel deferred.
///
/// **A mapping made with no `PageFrame` capability at all records itself as its own object**
/// (`object == phys`): `MemoryRegion::MAP` retypes a page and maps it in one step, and there is
/// never a capability to name. That is the honest encoding rather than a sentinel, because the page
/// really is the whole of what was mapped.
///
/// # BUGS
///
/// **Two capabilities sharing a base but not a length are one object here.** `PageFrame(p, 401)`
/// and `PageFrame(p, 74)` are distinct objects to `Cap`, and a revoke of the shorter one unmaps the
/// longer one's mappings of the pages they share. Carrying the length too would cost a fourth word
/// and take `LOG_ENTRIES` from 170 to 127 (a `LogEntry` would round up to 32 bytes), which is twice
/// the log pages a space pays now rather than 1.5x, to separate a pair nothing in the tree mints.
/// The failure is bounded in the safe direction: the over-broad unmap can only reach pages inside
/// the revoked run, and it is strictly narrower than the space-blind unmap this replaced. Named
/// here because a reader who trusts "capability-scoped" without qualification would be wrong.

/// the allocator then handed to somebody else, the use-after-free §13 (capability revocation and
/// untyped reclamation) exists to prevent. §13 named it ("the one honest race") in 2026-07 and
/// deferred it to seL4's answer, a mapping-database lock held across the whole operation. This is
/// that lock, and it was already there: the registry every unmap pass takes.
/// `system_tests::user::map_revocation_window_tests` drove a sweep into the gap on both paths under
/// both sweeps, and all four kept the mapping. `MemoryRegion::MAP` had the same window against a
/// region's `DESTROY` (a retype before the claim, a record after the scan), and it is closed here
/// the same way.
///
/// **The invariant now is that a mapping of a capability's frame is made and recorded under the
/// same hold the capability was read under.** [`MappingHold::current_cap`] is the read, and it
/// takes the running thread's own table lock beneath this one (`CAPABILITY_TABLE`, 57, under
/// `MAPPINGS`, 59). A sweep deletes from that table before it takes this registry, so it is wholly
/// before the read (the slot is empty and the `MAP` answers `NoSuchSlot`, as if it had started
/// after the revoke) or its unmap pass starts after the record (the scan finds it). Nothing in
/// between can be expressed, and the mapping is never live in a page table a sweep has already
/// passed: unlike record-then-recheck, there is no instant where a reclaimed page is mapped and
/// about to be taken back.
///
/// **Held across page-table construction**, which is the cost: tables come from a region
/// (`MEMORY_REGION`, 58, beneath this), and a run maps every page under one hold, so every other
/// mapping and every unmap pass on the machine waits behind it. `MAP` is spawn-time and setup work,
/// never a step of the IPC round trip. On one hart it is cheaper, not dearer, because a run now
/// takes the registry once rather than once per page: riscv64 icount, 2026-10-04, `map_el0` 120 to
/// 113 ticks a map (-6.3%) and `spawn_el0` 2,221 to 2,208 a spawn (-0.6%), every other row within

/// capability should not have (§132 option B, refused). The overlapping holder keeps both its
/// capability and its mappings; only what was mapped under *this* capability goes.
///
/// **Revocation still owes a device nothing** (§132's question 3, deliberately not answered by this
/// work). `PageFrame::REVOKE` is a CPU-side operation: the gpu driver registers its DMA window with
/// `virtio::register`, that window is not derived from any capability, and revoking one does not
/// narrow it. So a capability-perfect revocation of a surface leaves the device able to write those
/// pages until the driver's virtio registration is itself torn down. Coupling `PageFrame` and
/// `Virtio`, which are independent today, is a separate decision and remains an architect's call:

/// The unmap pass is one page per iteration: find a recorded page in range under the registry lock,
/// release it, then unmap (unmapping retakes the registry lock, so it cannot be called while it is
/// held). Each pass tombstones every record of its page, so the scan strictly shrinks and
/// terminates. A `MAP` that takes the registry between two iterations finds no capability (the
/// sweep above is finished) and a claimed region refuses to retype, so the scan cannot grow
/// ([`MappingHold`]).
///
/// **Then the tables, because page tables are not leaves.** `PageFrame::MAP` and
/// `MemoryRegion::MAP` build a space's intermediate tables out of a region the caller names, which
/// need not be the space's own, so the region going away can be a page table going away under a

/// (`system_tests::user::page_table_region_tests`: before this pass the space still translated
/// through a table the region had given back, and a later map wrote its leaf into it). Each such
/// table is in the space's log as a [`TABLE`] record ([`MappingHold::retype_table`]), and this
/// pass cuts each one in the range out of the walk that reaches it, flushes the space's tag, and
/// tombstones the records of everything that hung beneath it, under the registry so no `MAP` is
/// halfway through that walk. The space keeps running and loses that span, which is what already
