//! **The JH7110 Ethernet controller's control plane** (milestone 53 (the board's own peripherals:
//! network and storage on real silicon); notes/designware-ethernet.md).
//!
//! `kernel/src/e1000e.rs`'s shape, applied to radon's first port. This file ungates the port's
//! clocks and releases its resets, selects RGMII at the syscon, configures the YT8531 PHY, resets
//! the controller, **measures whether device DMA is coherent with the caches** before trusting a
//! single descriptor, programs both rings, negotiates a link and starts the DMA. Then
//! `kernel/src/user/designware_ethernet_service.rs` hands a process the controller's DMA page and
//! the region, and that process (`net_stack`, through
//! `components/src/designware_ethernet_transport.rs`) fills descriptors and moves the tails.
//! Every offset, bit, sequence and verdict here comes from `crates/designware_ethernet`; this file
//! is the volatile accesses the crate cannot make.
//!
//! Rule 2 holds in the way the clock driver states it: nothing below reaches a base address of
//! its own. Every window comes from `memory::jh7110_ethernet`, which read them out of the device
//! tree (or the constant both published trees agree on, and says which).
//!
//! # Scope note (rule 5, architectural parity)
//!
//! **This is a board driver for one chip, and it is riscv64-only on purpose.** The JH7110 is a
//! riscv64 part; no aarch64 or x86_64 machine nife runs on has this controller. What the rule asks
//! to be shared is shared: the network stack above it (`net_stack`, smoltcp, the socket contract)
//! is the same code on all three architectures, and this driver reaches it through the same
//! `Handoff` shape `e1000e` uses. The gap is recorded here and in milestone 53's block, with the
//! plan: a second board with Synopsys's Ethernet `QoS` controller (the RK3568 and RK3588 OpenBSD's `dwqe`
//! also drives are aarch64) would reuse the crate whole and need only its own glue beside
//! `designware_ethernet::jh7110`.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **None of this has run on silicon.** The crate's tests run against its simulation; the
//!   bench runbook in notes/designware-ethernet.md is the first run of any of it.
//! - **Waiting for a link is a bounded spin at bring-up**, up to [`LINK_WAIT_MS`], as `e1000e`'s
//!   is, holding a core once per wiring.
//! - **The DMA region is allocated once per boot and never returned**, like `e1000e`'s.
//! - **A non-coherent verdict refuses the port** rather than driving it with cache maintenance,
//!   because this tree has none for this machine yet (milestone 655 (DMA on a non-coherent RISC-V
//!   machine)). An inconclusive verdict does not refuse: the reading says coherent, and the
//!   bring-up says which it was.
