//! **The xHCI controller's bring-up policy** (milestone 242 (USB host and HID, because on
//! commodity hardware the keyboard is not a UART); notes/usb.md).
//!
//! What the kernel does for a USB host controller, which is less than it does for NVMe and on
//! purpose. NVMe kept its admin plane at EL1 (DECISIONS §86 (whether an NVMe driver can leave the
//! kernel), option 2a) because creating a queue is where a ring's physical address is named. An
//! xHCI names physical addresses everywhere (the slot array, the command ring, the event ring,
//! every transfer ring, every input context), and enumeration means **reading what a device chose
//! to send**, which is the last thing to do at EL1. So this module does only the things that are
//! not the driver's to do, and the whole controller goes to a confined EL0 process:
//!
//! 1. **Find it** (`pci::find_xhci_device`): place the BAR, enable decoding and bus mastering,
//!    resolve the interrupt (MSI-X, MSI, or the INTx swizzle, as this machine delivers them).
//! 2. **Take it from the firmware** ([`take_from_firmware`]): the USB Legacy Support handshake,
//!    so a PC's BIOS stops answering SMIs for the keyboard. A firmware relationship, which no
//!    process should hold.
//! 3. **Decide which register pages the driver is mapped**
//!    (`extensible_host_controller_interface::register_window`): every page of BAR0 except the
//!    ones the MSI-X table and pending-bit array sit on, refused outright if a register the driver
//!    needs shares one of those pages.
//! 4. **Allocate its DMA region and confine the controller to it**, and refuse to go further when
//!    the IOMMU does not confine this requester id. A process that holds a whole xHCI register file
//!    can point the controller at any physical address it names; the IOMMU is the only thing that
//!    bounds that, so without it there is no driver to start. NVMe runs unconfined on a machine
//!    with no IOMMU; this one does not, and the difference is that this process names every ring.
//!
//! The kernel never resets the controller, never writes a ring and never reads a descriptor. Rule
//! 2 holds the usual way: the policy function reaches for the bus and the allocator, and nothing
//! below it does.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The first xHCI on the bus is the only one.** A PC with a second controller (a USB 3.1 add-in
//!   card, or a laptop's Thunderbolt one) has its keyboard found only if it is on the first.
//! - **No confinement, no keyboard.** A machine whose IOMMU does not own the controller's requester
//!   id (radon has no IOMMU; a VT-d table whose catch-all unit is not the one this kernel brought
//!   up) gets a refusal sentence and keystrokes over the UART only. That is the design, and it is a
//!   cost.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 242 (USB host and HID)). The crate's name, as
//! `kernel/src/non_volatile_memory_express.rs` takes its crate's: the volatile half of one pair.
