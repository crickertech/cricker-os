// The hang watchdog: **two independent mechanisms, because there are two ways a test never
// finishes.** Both run off the timer IRQ, so they cost a couple of atomic loads per tick and cannot
// perturb the scheduling they watch. Either one firing fails the run with a thread dump.
//
// **1. The no-progress heartbeat (a lost wakeup).** [`note_progress`] bumps a counter on every
// observable kernel step: a completed IPC rendezvous or device-IRQ wake (`sched::wake` /
// `wake_load_aware`) and every line of console output (`console::_print`, which covers each test's
// "ok"). Progress is also credited when any online core is running a real, non-idle thread
// ([`any_cpu_running_real_work`]). If none of that happens for ~60 s the run fails. That second
// signal is what lets `std_net` pass honestly: it spends its ~300 s in net_stack's *userspace* smoltcp
// poll, CPU-bound, making no wake and no output for stretches over a minute, yet a real thread runs
// the whole time. A genuine lost wakeup is the opposite: every thread `Blocked`, every core parked on
// its idle thread.
//
// **2. The per-test wall-clock ceiling (a livelock).** The heartbeat above cannot see a livelock that
// *makes progress*, and that is not hypothetical: the RedoxFS repeat-write loop spins in an allocator
// commit while still doing blk IPC, so every rendezvous reset the heartbeat and a failure that used to
// be a loud 60 s trip became an infinite silent hang at ~400% CPU. A progress-only instrument cannot
// distinguish that from healthy work, so it needs a second question: not "is anything happening?" but
// "has this test taken longer than it is allowed to?" [`Testable::run`] stamps a start time and a
// budget per test; this fails the run when the budget is exceeded **even though progress is being
// made**. Turning a loud failure into a silent hang is strictly worse than the flake the heartbeat
// fixed, which is why both mechanisms are live.
//
// What each can and cannot see, stated plainly:
//
//   - The heartbeat catches a total stall (deadlock, lost wakeup) fast, and catches it wherever it
//     happens, including before any test starts. It is blind to any loop that keeps doing IPC.
//   - The ceiling catches any test that does not terminate, livelock included, regardless of how busy
//     it looks. It cannot fire faster than the budget, so it is a backstop, not a diagnostic.
//   - Neither can tell a livelock from slow-but-correct work *while it is running*; only the budget,
//     which is a human declaration of expected cost, separates them. That is the honest limit.
//   - **The heartbeat credits work by ANY thread, including leftovers from earlier tests, and that
//     blinded it once for real** (milestone 31 phase 2). The FS server died of a stack overflow, its
//     client blocked on a `CALL` nobody would ever answer, and nothing in that test made progress
//     again; but processes left spinning by earlier tests kept `any_cpu_running_real_work` true, so
//     the 60 s stall never registered and only the ceiling fired. Attributing a thread to the running
//     test would fix it and the kernel cannot: a test's processes are ordinary processes. The defence
//     is the ceiling, plus reading the thread dump's **address-space roots** rather than its program
//     counters, which is what tells a leftover spinner from the process under test.
//   - **A ceiling failure reports the ceiling, not the cost.** "ran 900 s" against a 900 s budget is
//     the budget being spent and says nothing about how long the work would take. The same incident
//     had that number read as evidence of honest slowness, which sent an investigation looking for a
//     slow path in a test whose server was already dead. Raising a budget to "measure" something
//     returns only the new budget.
//   - `helpers/qemu-bounded.sh` remains the outermost backstop, for a kernel that wedges so hard the
//     timer IRQ itself stops. It did NOT fire in the reported case because that run invoked `cargo`
//     directly instead of going through the wrapper: **a bypassable backstop is not a backstop**,
//     which is precisely why the ceiling belongs in the kernel, where nothing can route around it.
