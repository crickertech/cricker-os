//! **Milestone 53 (the board's own peripherals: network and storage on real silicon)'s storage
//! bench boot**, behind the `storage_bench` feature, riscv64 only, name provisional.
//!
//! Nothing emulates radon's SD/MMC controller, so the first time this driver meets the part is a
//! boot on the bench, and the boot has to say everything at once: what the firmware left, what the
//! controller is, what card answered, what the card holds, and how fast it reads. Every line is
//! prefixed `storage-bench:` so a serial capture and a photograph of a screen read the same way.
//!
//! In order, for the microSD slot (slot 1) and then the eMMC socket (slot 0):
//!
//! 1. the slot as the tree describes it;
//! 2. its clocks and reset as the firmware left them, then walked through
//!    `jh7110_clock_and_reset::SDIO_BRING_UP` (every step idempotent);
//! 3. the controller's identity (`VERID`, `HCON`, the FIFO, `CDETECT`) and the five registers the
//!    firmware's driver last wrote, read before anything is written;
//! 4. the read-only probe (`designware_mobile_storage::bench::read_only`): identification, the CID,
//!    the capacity, sector 0's partition table, the first partition's boot sector, and an 8 MiB
//!    sequential read from the start of that partition, timed;
//! 5. **only on the microSD slot and only in a build made with `NIFE_STORAGE_BENCH_WRITE=scratch`**,
//!    the scratch write test (`bench::scratch_write`): up to eight sectors before the first
//!    partition, read, overwritten with a pattern, read back, restored, read back;
//! 6. on the microSD slot, the same card through the EL0 block server
//!    (`components/src/designware_mobile_storage.rs`), called the way the FS server calls a block
//!    server: over the first partition, read-only, in a read-only build (block 0 must be the boot
//!    sector, `WRITE` must be `EROFS`, a block past the window `EINVAL`); over the scratch range,
//!    writable, in a write build (one block read, overwritten, read back, restored).
//!
//! Then one verdict line about the microSD slot, and a halt.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The booted system has no block device on radon yet.** This boot proves the EL0 server on
//!   a window it picks for the test; which window the booted system serves is an architect's
//!   call, in the 53 block.
//! - **It re-initializes the card U-Boot booted from.** `CMD0` puts the card back to idle, which
//!   is harmless (the next power-on does the same) and means this boot cannot hand the card back
//!   to anything that expected it selected. It halts instead.
//! - **The eMMC socket is probed read-only, always.** Whether radon has a module fitted is a bench
//!   fact this boot reports rather than assumes, and nothing here writes to one.
