//! **The saved register context of a thread, and how a new one is faked.** The Rust half of
//! `context.s`.
//!
//! This is arch-specific by nature: a saved context *is* a particular CPU's callee-saved register
//! set, and starting a new thread means writing those registers by hand so the first `switch_to`
//! into it lands running. The portable `thread.rs` names none of this; it asks for a context "for a
//! kernel thread" or "for a user thread" and gets back an opaque [`Context`] it only ever stores and
//! hands to [`switch_to`]. That is the seam that lets a second architecture (RISC-V, with a
//! different callee-saved set and different trampolines) drop in without touching `thread.rs`. See
//! notes/riscv-port.md, the `Context` leak.

/// The callee-saved registers, as `switch_to` pushes them.

/// **This layout is a contract with `context.s`.** Twelve `u64`s, 96 bytes, in exactly this
/// order. Reorder a field here and the assembly restores the wrong register into the wrong
/// place, and the thread resumes with a frame pointer where its return address should be.
///
/// The fields are deliberately private: the two ways a fresh context is ever built ([`for_kernel_thread`](Context::for_kernel_thread),
/// [`for_user_thread`](Context::for_user_thread)) live here, so which register carries the closure,
/// the entry, or the trampoline is knowledge that never escapes `arch/`.
