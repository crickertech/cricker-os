# The S-mode trap vector and the U-mode return path.
#
# The RISC-V analog of aarch64's vectors.s. RISC-V has one trap entry (stvec) and does NOT switch
# stacks automatically: a trap from U-mode arrives still on the user stack, with the user's `tp`.
#
# So `sscratch` holds a pointer to this hart's per-hart trap stash (`struct TrapStash` in mod.rs), in
# BOTH U- and S-mode. The stash carries what the entry needs to recover before it has a stack or a
# valid `tp`:
#
#   0(stash)  kernel_sp  the current thread's kernel-stack top (where a U-mode trap lands)
#   8(stash)  percpu     this hart's PerCpu pointer (the kernel `tp`)
#   16(stash) scratch0   a scratch word
#   24(stash) scratch1   a scratch word
#
# Unlike the old single-hart design (which kept the kernel `tp` in one global and the kernel-stack top
# directly in `sscratch`), the stash is per-hart and reached through the per-hart `sscratch`, so every
# hart recovers ITS OWN `tp` and stack. That is what makes the trap path SMP-correct. Whether a trap
# came from U- or S-mode is read from `sstatus.SPP`, not from `sscratch` (which is never 0 now).
#
# The frame layout is `struct TrapFrame`: x[0..32] then sepc, scause, stval, sstatus (288 bytes).

# `.text.hot.*` puts trap_entry, and the trap_return it falls through to, in the pinned hot
# section: milestone 796 (pin the hot trap path's placement). See
# notes/benchmarks/kernel-footprint-and-caches.md, "The hot section".

# CFI: see notes/cfi-unwind.md, "The hard case: a trap is not a call" (written for aarch64's
# vectors.s; the same reasoning applies here). `.cfi_signal_frame` marks this as an
# interrupt/exception frame, not an ordinary call. The GP-register offsets below are correct, plain
# arithmetic on this function's own stores and let a debugger recover x1..x31 from any PC in this
# function. **ra (x1) is left `.cfi_undefined`**, even though its real value is saved a few lines
# down at `1*8(sp)`: RISC-V's default return-address column is ra, and describing it there would
# tell an unwinder "the interrupted code's caller is at this ra value", which is false -- the true
# resume point is `sepc`, a data value the hardware does not restore into any register on its own.
# Unlike AArch64 (ELR_mode, DWARF register 33; see vectors.s), the RISC-V DWARF register mapping has
# no dedicated pseudo-register for sepc, so there is no spec-correct alternative column to offer
# either; this is a real gap in the mapping, not only a GDB limitation. See the BUGS section in the
# note.

    # MASK INTERRUPTS FIRST. The aarch64 twin of this sequence had a real race here (see the long
    # comment on RESTORE_CONTEXT in arch/aarch64/vectors.s, milestone 22 phase B.2), and the same
    # window exists on RISC-V for the same reason: `sepc` and `sstatus` are the sret's only record of
    # where to go and at what privilege, and a trap taken between the `csrw sepc` below and the
    # `csrw sstatus` two instructions later overwrites both. The nested handler's own trap_return puts
    # the S-mode values back, so our `sret` would return to U-mode at a *kernel* address, which reads
    # as an impossible instruction fault.
    #
    # On a trap return the window is already closed (trap entry clears sstatus.SIE, and the frame's
    # saved sstatus carries SIE = 0 through the `csrw`). The exposed path is `user_return`, the first
    # entry to U-mode, which is jumped to from ordinary kernel code with interrupts enabled. Clearing
    # SIE costs nothing: the `csrw sstatus` and then the `sret` set the final state regardless.
    csrci   sstatus, 2          # clear SIE (bit 1)

    # AND THE GUARD IS NOT SELF-SUFFICIENT HERE, WHICH IS WHERE RISC-V DIVERGES FROM AARCH64. The
    # aarch64 comment says the mask covers any future path "by construction"; that claim is true
    # there and NOT true here, so do not read it across.
    #
    # aarch64 stages the return state in SPSR_EL1, a register separate from the live PSTATE, so
    # nothing between the `msr daifset` and the `eret` can put interrupts back on. RISC-V has ONE
    # register: `sstatus` holds both the staged fields (SPP, SPIE) and the LIVE enable bit (SIE). So
    # the `csrw sstatus, t0` thirteen lines below writes the frame's SIE straight into the live bit,
    # and if a frame ever carried SIE = 1 it would re-open interrupts for the ~32 instructions
    # between there and the `sret`, with `sepc` already staged. The `csrci` above would have bought
    # nothing.
    #
    # It is safe today because of an INVARIANT, not because of this instruction: every trap frame
    # carries SIE = 0. Two sources, both checked:
    #
    #   - a real trap: the hardware clears SIE on trap entry (moving it to SPIE), so the `csrr t1,
    #     sstatus` in trap_entry above always reads SIE = 0;
    #   - a fabricated frame: TrapFrame::for_user_entry sets SPIE and UXL only. There is a
    #     compile-time assertion next to it that keeps SIE out; see exceptions.rs.
    #
    # If you add a third way to build a frame, that assertion is the thing to copy. See

# The twin of aarch64's `dispatch_on_interrupt_stack` in vectors.s, and the same contract: the frame
# stays where trap_entry built it (a preempted thread's frame must survive until that thread runs
# again, which a per-hart stack cannot promise), and everything above it moves. Rust decides whether
# to switch, in `interrupt_stack::top_for_trap`; this only moves `sp`.
#
# s0 holds the interrupted sp across the call because it is callee-saved, so the handler cannot
# clobber it and it needs no slot on either stack. Its own save costs the interrupted stack 16 bytes.
# `riscv_trap_body` returns its bool in a0, which nothing here touches.
# CFI: an ordinary function, `call`ed and `ret`urning, so the default frame is real. The one wrinkle
# is the same one `switch_to` has (see arch/aarch64/context.s's CFI note): `mv sp, a1` moves onto an
# unrelated interrupt stack partway through, so the CFA formula is restated in terms of `s0` (which
# holds the pre-switch sp and does not move again until it is restored) rather than `sp`, exactly
