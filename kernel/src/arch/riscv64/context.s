# The context switch and the two first-run trampolines, RISC-V. The asm half of context.rs.
#
# This mirrors arch/aarch64/context.s exactly in structure; only the register set differs. A
# voluntary switch is an ordinary function call, so the RISC-V calling convention already lets the
# caller assume the temporaries (t0-t6, a0-a7) are clobbered. We save only what the convention
# says a callee preserves: ra (the return address, i.e. WHERE TO RETURN) and s0-s11. sp is the
# saved state itself, so it is not stored in the frame; it is what `switch_to` swaps.
#
# The trick is identical to aarch64: `ret` returns into `ra`, and by that point `ra` was loaded
# from the OTHER thread's stack, so the return lands in a different thread. See notes/threads.md.
#
# UNPROVEN until RISC-V boots (the console step and beyond exercise it). It assembles and links now,
# which is all the compile milestone claims.

# In the pinned hot section, because every IPC that blocks runs it: milestone 796 (pin the
# hot trap path's placement).
# See notes/benchmarks/kernel-footprint-and-caches.md, "The hot section".

# swap: `.cfi_def_cfa_offset 112` is a formula in terms of the CURRENT sp, and `next_context` (a1)
# is by construction the exact sp another thread's own earlier call to this function (or
# `Context::for_*_thread`'s synthetic frame) left behind after this same `addi sp, sp, -112`. So
