//! **radon's SD/MMC block server's wiring** (milestone 53 (the board's own peripherals: network
//! and storage on real silicon)), in milestone 261 (the NVMe driver leaves the kernel)'s shape.
//!
//! The kernel keeps the admin plane: it ungates the controller's clocks and releases its reset in
//! the shared SYS clock generator, then hands a process one device-typed page of the controller,
//! the transfer region it will share with its client, two endpoints, and the window of the card it
//! may serve. Everything else, the card included, is the process's to bring up:
//! `components/src/designware_mobile_storage.rs` has what it holds and what it is refused.
//!
//! **The booted system does not start it yet** ([`PROVEN_ON_SILICON`]). Its first caller is the
//! `storage_bench` boot, which starts it over a window it chose from the card's own partition table
//! and reads and writes through it the way the FS server would. Which window the booted system
//! gives it is an open question for an architect, in the 53 block.
