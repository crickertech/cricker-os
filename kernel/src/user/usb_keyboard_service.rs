//! **Wiring for the USB keyboard driver** (milestone 242 (USB host and HID, because on commodity
//! hardware the keyboard is not a UART); notes/usb.md).
//!
//! `kernel/src/extensible_host_controller_interface.rs` found the controller, took it from the
//! firmware, drew the register window and confined the DMA region; this file decides what the
//! process that drives it is handed, and the whole of the confinement claim is in the [`Spawn`]
//! literal below. It is `non_volatile_memory_express_service`'s shape, one device over.
//!
//! # What the driver holds, and what it is denied
//!
//! Held:
//!
//! - slot 0, the controller's **interrupt** (`Irq`, WAIT and ACK);
//! - slot 1, an **attach** endpoint (READ): the one message it ever receives there carries the
//!   endpoint its keystrokes go to, delegated by the progenitor once the line discipline exists.
//!   It is how a driver the kernel starts before the progenitor ends up holding `WRITE` on an
//!   endpoint the progenitor creates, without the kernel ever naming that endpoint;
//! - slot 2, a **report** endpoint (WRITE): one bring-up report, which the kernel waits for;
//! - mapped: **the register pages** [`extensible_host_controller_interface::register_window`]
//!   chose, device-typed: every page of BAR0 but the MSI-X table's and pending-bit array's;
//! - mapped: **the work pages of its DMA region** (`dma::WORK_PAGES`), normal memory.
//!
//! Denied, each a decision:
//!
//! - **The MSI-X pages.** Whoever writes the table aims the interrupt message, and with interrupt
//!   remapping off an aimed message is any vector on any CPU.
//! - **The scratchpad pages.** They are the controller's private memory; the driver writes their
//!   addresses and never their contents.
//! - **PCI configuration space.** It cannot turn bus mastering on or off, move a BAR, or touch MSI.
//! - **Any physical memory outside its region, by DMA.** The IOMMU confines the controller to the
//!   region before the driver starts, and [`crate::extensible_host_controller_interface::bring_up`]
//!   refuses to start one at all where it cannot.
//! - **Every endpoint but three.** No budget, no filesystem, no console, no clock.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The attach handshake is a blocking send.** If the driver died between its report and its
//!   first receive on the attach endpoint, the progenitor's `SEND_CAP` there would block the boot.
//!   The driver receives on it immediately after reporting and does nothing else first, so the
//!   window is one system call wide; it is a window.
//! - **Enumeration after the report is silent.** A keyboard plugged in later is found and works,
//!   but a device refused later has nobody to say so to: the report endpoint has one message.
//!
//! Name: provisional. A `<program>_service`, as `non_volatile_memory_express_service` is, so its
//! name is the program's plus the suffix and carries no decision of its own.
