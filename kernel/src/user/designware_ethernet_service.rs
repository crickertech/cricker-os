//! **Wiring for `net_stack` over the JH7110's Ethernet port** (milestone 53 (the board's own
//! peripherals: network and storage on real silicon); notes/designware-ethernet.md).
//!
//! `e1000e_service`'s shape for radon. The kernel's `designware_ethernet` module brings the port up
//! and programs its rings; this file decides what the process that drives them is handed, and the
//! whole of that decision is the spawn below.
//!
//! # What the server holds, and what it is denied
//!
//! Held, in the virtio server's slot layout so the rest of `net_stack` is unchanged:
//!
//! - slot 0, the **report** endpoint (WRITE): the DHCP lease, once;
//! - slots 1 and 2 **empty**: no interrupt and no `Virtio` transport;
//! - slot 3, the heap's **budget**; slot 4, the **`Stack`** endpoint (READ); slots 5 and 6, the
//!   **notification and timer** the poll loop sleeps on;
//! - mapped: **the DMA region**, [`::designware_ethernet::layout::PAGES`] pages of normal memory;
//! - mapped: **the controller's DMA page** (`0x1000` to `0x1fff` of its window), device-typed,
//!   which holds the two tail pointers it must write;
//! - `arg0`/`arg1`: [`::designware_ethernet::Handoff`], the MAC address and the region's base.
//!
//! Denied: **the MAC page** (`0x0000` to `0x0fff`): the MAC configuration, the packet filter, the
//! station address and the MDIO bus. It cannot reach the PHY, change its address or receive
//! promiscuously. And no `Irq` capability: it polls, as the `e1000e` server does.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The DMA page is an administrative page too.** It holds both ring bases and the bit that
//!   resets the whole controller (`crates/designware_ethernet`'s `regs` header), and the JH7110
//!   has no IOMMU in front of this device. So the server can point a ring, and so the device's
//!   DMA, anywhere in memory, and can reset the MAC; it is as confined as its arithmetic, which is
//!   milestone 261 (the NVMe driver leaves the kernel)'s position on a machine with no IOMMU,
//!   stated plainly rather than implied by a page split that looks like more.
//! - **One wiring at a time**, for `e1000e_service`'s reason.
//! - **The booted system does not use it yet** ([`PROVEN_ON_SILICON`]).
