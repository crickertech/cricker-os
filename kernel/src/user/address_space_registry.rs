/// **How many address spaces the registry can name at once: every one the machine can hold.**
///
/// §249 (a running address space stays nameable) made the registry the owner of every space, bound
/// to a thread or not, so a running process now holds an entry for as long as it lives. Until then
/// this was 32 and named only spaces under construction, which was right while `CONFIGURE` moved a
/// space out into its thread.
///
/// **The number is [`crate::revoke::MAX_SPACES`], and that is an argument rather than a
/// coincidence.** Every [`AddressSpace`] registers with the revocation registry when it is built
/// and leaves it only when it drops, so no more than that many spaces can exist at once, and an
/// entry here holds exactly one. Sized the same, this table cannot fill while a space that wants an
/// entry exists, which is what lets [`register_bound_address_space`] treat a full table as a broken
/// invariant rather than an error every kernel spawn path would have to carry. The `const` assert
/// below keeps the two from drifting apart; the revocation registry's own constant is the thread
/// ceiling plus headroom, so the argument follows the thread ceiling when it moves.
///
/// What it costs, measured from the type rather than estimated: `registry_footprint`, which
/// `system_tests`' `running_space_tests` prints, is 21,904 bytes of `.bss` on all three
/// architectures at 288 slots (at 32 it was about a ninth of that; not measured then): 72 bytes an entry and a 4-byte
/// generation each. That is the whole of what every process holding an entry needs, because the
/// space's pages were always paid from its own region. Nothing walks the empty slots:
/// `generational_table::Table` bounds every sweep by its highest live slot, and the context switch
/// never reads this table at all ([`BoundSpace`]).
