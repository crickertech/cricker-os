//! **The `e1000e` NIC's control plane** (milestone 494 (a driver for the network card a PC actually
//! has); notes/e1000e.md).
//!
//! The kernel half of milestone 261 (the NVMe driver leaves the kernel)'s shape applied to a second
//! device. This file finds the controller, confines its DMA to one region, resets it, reads its MAC
//! address, programs both rings' base registers and turns the receiver and transmitter on; then
//! `kernel/src/user/e1000e_service.rs` hands a process the two queue pages of BAR0 and the region,
//! and that process (`net_stack`, through `components/src/e1000e_transport.rs`) fills descriptors
//! and moves tails. Every offset, bit and layout here comes from `crates/e1000e`.
//!
//! What stays here is what the process must not be able to do: reset the device, change the MAC
//! address or the receive filter, turn on promiscuous receive, or reach the PHY. All of it is on
//! BAR0's pages 0 and 5, which the process is never mapped. **What does not stay here is ring
//! placement**: the ring base registers share a page with the tails (`crates/e1000e`'s header), so
//! a process that drives the data plane can repoint a ring, and the IOMMU domain built below is the
//! whole of what bounds the device's DMA.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Two bring-ups share this file, and QEMU proves one of them.** The 82574L's reset is this
//!   file's own; an I219 instead runs FreeBSD's three passes from `crates/e1000e/src/pch/`
//!   (`sequence`: the PHY workarounds, the global reset with the PHY, the hardware and copper-link
//!   setup), with the SPT ring flush here between the first two. The QEMU gates run the 82574L and
//!   the MDIO primitive both paths share (the PHY identifier read); the I219 passes first run on
//!   xenon (notes/e1000e.md's bench step). FreeBSD's link-up reconfiguration is not ported
//!   (`pch`'s `BUGS`).
//! - **Waiting for link is a bounded spin at bring-up**, up to [`LINK_WAIT_MS`]. QEMU's link is
//!   up at once; a real copper link negotiates in seconds, and a bring-up that times out still
//!   hands the process a working device whose first DHCP DISCOVER may simply be lost (smoltcp
//!   retries). The spin holds a core, which is acceptable once per wiring and not more often.
//! - **The DMA region is allocated once per boot and never returned**, like the NVMe region, so a
//!   boot that wires the NIC carries [`::e1000e::layout::PAGES`] pages for its whole life.
