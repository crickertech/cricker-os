//! **The process object** (milestone 812 (`std::thread::spawn` runs real threads in one address
//! space); §269 (how threads share a process) forks 1, 3 and 5, as calef ruled them on pull request
//! #1892). A page retyped from its creator's region, holding what its threads share: the capability
//! table, the address space, the count of its members, and how it ended. `abi::process` is the
//! contract; `notes/processes.md` has the argument and the limits.
//!
//! **Membership is counted, and the count is what keeps every pointer here sound.** A member's
//! `Thread::capability_table` points into this page and its `space` copy names this page's space.
//! The page is reclaimed only when no thread is a member ([`reap_region`]), and the space is
//! released only once the process has ended with no member left ([`leave`], [`destroy`]).
//!
//! **A process ends when its last member leaves**, as well as by `exit`, a fault, `DESTROY` or its
//! region. So a table no thread can reach is never joined again: the revocation sweeps walk tables
//! through threads, and a table with no member and a future would be one they missed.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 812's lane, 2026-10-10 UTC).
