# The RISC-V arch tests: closing a parity gap in the suite, not in the kernel

`kernel/src/arch/aarch64/` carried 21 unit tests. `kernel/src/arch/riscv64/` carried none, across
the same three files (`mmu.rs`, `timer.rs`, `exceptions.rs`). Both ISAs booted the same suite green,
so nothing looked wrong. But the missing tests are exactly the ones about *what the two ISAs do
differently*, where a port is most likely to be subtly wrong. DECISIONS §19 (architectural parity is a tenet) makes parity a gate; the gate was being applied to the
kernel's capabilities and not to the suite that proves them.

**The exercise found three defects**, which is the argument for the lane: "write the missing
tests" reads like bookkeeping until the tests refuse to pass.

## BUGS: what the missing tests were hiding

### 1. The timer ran at 80 Hz and said it was running at 100 Hz

`timer::tick` re-armed with `sbi_set_timer(now() + interval())`. `now()` is read inside the handler,
after the trap entry and the SBI `ecall` round trip to OpenSBI, so every period ran long by that
cost, never recovered.

aarch64 shipped and measured the same bug, and its module header documents it: `CNTV_TVAL_EL0` (relative) gave ~70 Hz against a configured 100 Hz, and `CNTV_CVAL_EL0`
(absolute, on a fixed grid) fixed it. RISC-V had the same defect for a different reason. SBI's
`set_timer` takes an absolute deadline but is write-only: unlike `CVAL`, the previous deadline
cannot be read back. So the grid has to be kept in software, and the easy alternative is
re-arming from the clock.

Measured, by reverting the fix and running `ticks_arrive_at_the_configured_rate`:

```
timer drift: 20 ticks in 25 periods
```

**80 Hz delivered against 100 Hz configured. One preemption in five, gone**, silently, on every
RISC-V boot since milestone 20. The fix is `DEADLINE[hart]`, an absolute deadline kept per hart and
advanced by exactly one interval, with the same drop-a-tick safety valve aarch64 has for the case
where the next deadline is already in the past.

### 2. `missed_ticks()` was a stub returning 0, defended by a backwards argument

The old comment said a missed tick was not a meaningful idea on this ISA, "since SBI set_timer
re-arms from `now`, so a late handler simply spaces the next tick out rather than dropping a count".
That is true and it is the wrong conclusion: re-arming from `now` is what made the count
*unmeasurable*, not what made it *unnecessary*. Holding a lock across a tick deadline costs
as much here as on aarch64; there was no instrument.

With the grid in place the count is real, and `a_long_critical_section_costs_a_tick` is what makes
the price of `IrqSafeMutex` visible on the second ISA.

### 3. `TICKS` was one global counter for a per-hart timer

aarch64's `TICKS` is `[AtomicU64; MAX_CPUS]`, and the comment on it explains why (DECISIONS §11): a
single counter is advanced by *every* core's tick, so "holding a lock stops my ticks" stops being
observable, because masking interrupts masks only the holding core.

RISC-V had one global. Under `-smp 4` the other three harts kept counting into the same word.
Measured, by reverting to the global and running `holding_a_lock_masks_the_timer`: 61 ticks landed
during a critical section that masked this hart's interrupts. aarch64's written reasoning was never carried across.

None of the three is a capability gap, which is why the parity record (notes/riscv-parity-scope.md)
did not catch them: each is a *quality of implementation* property only a test looks at.

## EXAMPLES: translating a property instead of transliterating a test

The rule: find the property the aarch64 test asserts, then assert it the RISC-V way. The mechanisms
differ almost everywhere.

| aarch64 mechanism | RISC-V mechanism |
|---|---|
| `TTBR0` (user) + `TTBR1` (kernel), two registers | one `satp`; every process root carries a copy of the kernel's top-level entries |
| four translation levels, 48-bit VA | Sv39: three levels, 39-bit VA, high half is 256 GiB |
| `VBAR_EL1`, a 16-slot table, 2048-byte aligned | `stvec`, one entry point, 4-byte aligned, low 2 bits are the MODE field |
| `tlbi` + `dsb`, hardware broadcast to other cores | `sfence.vma`, local, plus an SBI RFENCE IPI to the other harts |
| generic timer, `CNTV_CVAL_EL0` readable back | SBI TIME `set_timer`, write-only, so the deadline lives in software |
| PXN and UXN: two independent execute-never bits | one `X` bit whose privilege is decided by the `U` bit |
| an architectural device memory type in the descriptor | no such field in base Sv39; an RSW software bit stands in |
| EL1, with `CurrentEL` readable | S-mode, with no way to read the current privilege at all |

Three differences change what a test can honestly claim, and each test's doc comment says so:

- **`kernel_text_is_executable_and_not_writable`** keeps aarch64's `!is_user_executable` assertion,
  but it is not carrying weight on Sv39. One `X` bit plus the `U` bit means `Sv39::leaf_flags`
  reports kernel-exec or user-exec and never both, so given kernel-exec the other cannot fail. It
  stays because the kernel cares about the property and the format may change (Svpbmt, or a
  future format with separate bits).

- **`the_uart_is_mapped_as_device_memory`** is a weaker claim here. On aarch64 the device type is an
  architectural PTE field, and getting it wrong lets the CPU speculatively read MMIO, which for a
  UART FIFO register *consumes the byte*. Base Sv39 has no such field, so `paging::Sv39` carries the
  flag in an RSW software bit and QEMU's `virt` derives the real memory type from the physical
  address. The test asserts the kernel's bookkeeping is right, not that the hardware was told. It
  still catches the mistake worth catching (mapping the UART with `Flags::kernel_data()`), which is
  what the mutation below confirms.

- **`a_low_address_does_not_translate_when_no_process_is_running`** is a *stronger* claim here, if
  the addresses are chosen carefully. `Mapper::translate` returns `None`
  for anything outside its half before walking a single entry, so a test address above 2^38
  would pass without reading any page table and prove nothing. All three addresses are inside Sv39's
  low half on purpose.

### The one property that could not be translated honestly, and was fixed rather than translated

aarch64's `asid_tagging_keeps_address_spaces_apart_without_flushes` proves two things: distinct
spaces get distinct ASIDs, and switching between them flushes nothing, so their TLB entries
coexist.

The second half was not true on RISC-V, because `write_satp` followed every `csrw satp` with a bare
`sfence.vma`, which discards the whole TLB. So the ASID was made irrelevant on the very next
instruction. An isolation test here would have passed with ASID tagging removed entirely, so it
could not fail for its stated reason.

What shipped instead is `the_satp_carries_the_address_spaces_asid`, which proves the half that was
real: distinct nonzero ASIDs, placed at bits 59:44 where the hardware reads them, without disturbing
the MODE field above or the root PPN below (they are packed with no slack, so a shift that is off by
four lands in one or the other). It still earns its keep as the only test that would catch a wrong
shift.

Milestone 58 (RISC-V TLB shootdown) closed it. The follow-up this section once described (drop the flush and the aarch64
property becomes true) was right about the goal and understated the work: the flush was covering for the fact that `flush_asid` was local, because
`sfence.vma` does not broadcast. So the order was the shootdown first, then the removal, gated on a
runtime probe of `satp.ASID`'s implemented width. The witness now runs on both ISAs and a new
portable test, `an_asid_flush_reaches_the_other_cores`, proves the broadcast half. See
notes/riscv-tlb-shootdown.md.

## What has no RISC-V analogue

- **`el1_runs_on_sp_el1` has no analogue.** At EL1, `sp` means `SP_EL1` or `SP_EL0` depending on
  `SPSel`, so the kernel and a user trap frame can be made to share one stack pointer register by
  accident. RISC-V has one `sp` per hart and no `SPSel`; the question cannot be asked. The
  *adjacent* RISC-V hazard is real but different (the kernel must recover its own `tp` and stack
  after a U-mode trap, through `sscratch` and the per-hart `TrapStash`), and it already has its
  witnesses in `arch::percpu_matches_hart` and the SMP suite.

- **`running_at_el1` has no direct analogue, and needs none.** RISC-V deliberately gives S-mode no
  way to read its own privilege level: there is no `CurrentEL`. But
  `breakpoint_is_caught_and_execution_resumes` proves it anyway, and its doc comment says so. The
  breakpoint arm of the dispatcher is guarded by `!from_user` (`sstatus.SPP == 1`), so `BRK_COUNT`
  cannot move unless the trap came from S-mode; and the trap could not have reached our handler at
  all from M-mode, where `mtvec` (OpenSBI's) owns it. A count that went up is a machine executing in
  S-mode. A `main.rs` comment promising this analogue "arrives with the RISC-V boot path" outlived
  milestone 20 (a portable HAL) and now points here.

- **`asid_tagging_keeps_address_spaces_apart_without_flushes` is half-translatable**, covered above.

That is the whole residue. The gap was never a scoping decision and needs none now.

## How each test was proved able to fail

A test that cannot fail is worse than no test, because it reads as coverage. Every one of the 22 was
run against a deliberately broken kernel and confirmed red, one at a time (a failing assertion ends
the run, so mutations cannot be batched). The mutations stayed in the lane's scratch driver; the table is
the record.

Nineteen were proved by breaking the code they check. Three could not be, and the reason is the
same on both ISAs.

| test | mutation | what it printed |
|---|---|---|
| `mmu_is_enabled` | `is_enabled` reads bits 59:56 instead of `satp.MODE` at 63:60 | `satp.MODE reads as Bare` |
| `a_low_address_does_not_translate...` | map one page in the kernel root's low half, as a surviving identity map would | `0x1000 translates through the live satp` |
| `the_guard_page_is_a_hole` | `map_everything` maps the guard page (and `verify`'s new assertion dropped) | `the guard page IS mapped` |
| `kernel_text_is_executable_and_not_writable` | `Sv39::attrs` always sets `W` | `.text is WRITABLE: W^X is broken` |
| `kernel_rodata_is_read_only_and_not_executable` | `attrs` always sets `W`; and separately, always sets `X` | `.rodata is writable` / `.rodata is executable` |
| `the_stack_is_writable_and_not_executable` | `attrs` always sets `X` | `the stack is EXECUTABLE` |
| `the_uart_is_mapped_as_device_memory` | UART mapped with `Flags::kernel_data()` | `the UART is not device memory` |
| `an_allocated_frame_is_reachable_through_the_mmu` | `attrs` always sets `X` | `RAM is executable` |
| `unmap_invalidates_the_tlb` | the local `sfence.vma` removed from `flush_tlb` | read back `0xaaaa...` through a VA remapped to the frame holding `0xbbbb...` |
| `the_kernel_mapper_refuses_to_overwrite` | `map_page` unmaps first instead of refusing | `left: Ok(())` |
| `the_satp_carries_the_address_spaces_asid` | `ttbr0_value` drops the ASID term | `two live spaces share an ASID` (both 0) |
| `the_timer_is_ticking` | `tick` does not count | `no timer interrupt in three tick periods` |
| `ticks_arrive_at_the_configured_rate` | the original relative re-arm restored | `20 ticks in 25 periods` |
| ~~`the_handler_keeps_up_when_no_lock_is_held`~~ | the handler spins for two intervals | missed 20 (**the test was deleted 2026-08-18**, see below) |
| `a_long_critical_section_costs_a_tick` | the original relative re-arm restored (no missed accounting) | `did NOT lose a tick` |
| `uptime_advances_monotonically` | `uptime_ms` divides by `TIMEBASE_HZ` instead of `TIMEBASE_HZ / 1000` | `uptime went backwards or stalled: 0 -> 0` |
| `holding_a_lock_masks_the_timer` | `TICKS` back to one global counter | 61 ticks landed inside the critical section |
| `breakpoint_is_caught_and_execution_resumes` | the dispatcher handles the breakpoint but does not record it | `the handler didn't run, but we resumed anyway?` |
| `registers_survive_a_trap` | the dispatcher zeroes `frame.x[18]`, as a wrong trap.s offset would | `the trap frame scrambled a register` |

*One row is struck through: `the_handler_keeps_up_when_no_lock_is_held` was deleted on both ISAs
by milestone 62 on 2026-08-18.* The mutation in that row is worth reading against the reason. Two
intervals of handler spin is almost exactly the boundary the assertion's taxonomy got wrong: under
one interval of resulting lateness it blamed this kernel, at one interval or more it blamed the
emulator and passed, and a handler slow by 2.5 periods was therefore exonerated in as many words.
The mutation still dies, on `script/icount`, where the handler is bounded in instructions the host
cannot move. See notes/load-sensitive-assertions.md.

The three that are true by construction on a machine that booted, and are marked as such:

| test | why the property cannot be broken | how the assertion was proved live |
|---|---|---|
| `the_kernel_lives_in_the_high_half` | the kernel is *linked* high; a low-linked kernel is a different port, not a mutation | raised the comparison bar 128 GiB; it read the real PC (`0xffffffc080279d62`) and failed |
| `the_direct_map_reaches_physical_memory` | the kernel reaches every page table through the direct map, so any break kills the boot | expected `pa + 4096`; it read the real translation and failed |
| `stvec_points_at_our_trap_entry` | a wrong `stvec` means the first trap never returns | expected `trap_entry + 4`; it read the real CSR and failed |

The same three are by-construction on aarch64 for the same reasons. They are kept for the
same reason: they cost nothing, and the day one *can* fail is the day someone changed the linker
script or the boot path, exactly when you want the assertion there. Naming the class is the honest
part; dropping them would hide it.

`mmu_is_enabled` sits between the two groups and its doc comment says so: the machine cannot reach
the assertion without paging, so the *property* is boot-implied, but the accessor's field extraction
is real and breakable, which is what the mutation exercised.

## Counts

Measured on this lane's branch, before and after. The two suite totals span the whole tree, so a
concurrent lane adding tests moves them; the arch-directory counts are this change's own.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `arch/aarch64` unit tests | 21 | 21 |
| `arch/riscv64` unit tests | 0 | 22 |
| riscv64 kernel suite | 127 | 149 |
| aarch64 kernel suite | 181 | 181 |

Twenty-two rather than twenty-one: the twelve MMU, six timer and three exceptions twins, plus
`the_satp_carries_the_address_spaces_asid`, which is the salvageable half of an aarch64 test that
lives in `kernel::user::tests`.

## What was still aarch64-only, and what porting it took (DONE, milestone 19, 2026-07-31)

The plan below was written when `kernel::user::tests` was ~30 tests that did not run on RISC-V. It
held up, so it is kept with each step's outcome. notes/riscv-parity-scope.md records what changed
and what is still gated.

The module comment blamed the tests: every one drove a hand-written aarch64 program through
`exec`, and several read aarch64 fault registers (`ESR`, `FAR`) directly. That was two separable
problems, and only the first was large.

1. The programs. The `user_program!` macro assembled aarch64 machine code inline (`hello`,
   `outlaw`, `spin`, `forged_elf`, and friends, from milestone 7a). Each would need a RISC-V
   twin: not a translation of 37 instructions, but 37 *programs*, each hand-assembled.

   **But it should not be done that way.** `riscv_virtio_tests` already showed the alternative: load
   a real ELF from the initrd and drive that. The programs are tiny and their behaviors are
   ordinary (return, syscall twice, read a forbidden address, spin forever, die on purpose), so they
   are `user/` binaries or entry roles of one binary, built by the existing toolchain for both
   targets. That deletes the aarch64 hand-assembly rather than duplicating it.

   **Outcome:** exactly this, and cheaper than sized. All five hand-assembled programs (three
   aarch64, two RISC-V) are gone, along with `exec`, the one-page raw-machine-code loader they
   needed, plus three duplicate copies of a nine-instruction stub the supervision tests already kept
   a portable pair of. The replacements are one new binary (`fixtures/src/outlaw.rs`, two roles) and the
   `interrupt_ignorer` that §24's interrupt work had already built. The trick that made one program serve two ISAs was
   passing the forbidden address in a register instead of baking it into the code.

2. The fault-register assertions. Roughly a third of the tests assert on `ESR`/`FAR` (that a
   fault was a *permission* fault and not a translation fault, that `FAR` named the exact address).
   Those assertions are the *point* of those tests, and genuinely arch-specific. The
   portable shape is a small arch-level accessor pair, something like "the last user fault's kind
   and address", implemented from `ESR`/`FAR` on aarch64 and from `scause`/`stval` on RISC-V. RISC-V
   already records the facts (`USER_FAULTS`; `user_fault` prints `sepc` and `stval`) but keeps no
   readable last-fault record.

   **Outcome:** `arch::UserFault`, and one correction to the sizing above. RISC-V records the
   *address* but genuinely cannot report the *kind*: `scause` has one code per access kind and no
   field says why the walk refused, so permission-versus-translation is not a fact this ISA hands
   over at all. The classifier walks the page tables the hardware just walked to derive it, which is
   an inference rather than a measurement, and the code says so in a `BUGS` note. Two compositor
   assertions that had been gated off RISC-V for want of a last-fault address came along for free.

The plan did not anticipate a third thing: the module was blocked on a stale comment as much as on
machine code. `hello` carries milestone 7 (user mode) through 19 role catalog and xtask called it
"aarch64-wired"; three quarters of that sentence had been false, and the last quarter
was six syscalls hand-rolled in aarch64 `asm!` that `user_mode_runtime` had had portable versions of since
19f.6. Deleting the duplicates was the whole port for roughly twenty of the tests. Sizing a job from
what the comments say it needs is how an afternoon's work stays undone for a year.

Sized in notes/riscv-parity-scope.md's S/M/L units: M, one to two sessions, in independently
useful commits. That was right.

The *portable* coverage in that module was already green on both ISAs. What RISC-V was missing was the userspace-boundary assertions, not the capability model.
