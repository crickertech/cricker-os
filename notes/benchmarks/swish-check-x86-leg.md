# The swish-check x86_64 leg: what its seconds were

*An appendix to [`notes/benchmarks.md`](../benchmarks.md), from milestone 628 (provisional) on
2026-10-03 UTC. Name: provisional (the 628 lane). It follows
[icount tick scales](icount-tick-scales.md), which attributed the leg's cost to the paint path.
Milestone 624 (the x86_64 paint path stops repainting the world) then halved it.*

## The finding: the leg was paced by the timer, not by the emulator

After milestone 624 the x86_64 leg still cost 7.7 s a line on CI's arm64 runner against
aarch64's 0.2 s.
That is run 37083676625: 128 lines in 985.3 s. Most of that time the guest was doing
nothing. Sampling the vCPU through the QEMU monitor while three `caps` lines ran (patagonia, TCG,
1,378 samples over 9.5 s) found it halted (`HLT=1`) in 1,034 of them, 75 percent.

Three measurements say what it was waiting for.

- The second boot's eight lines cost the same everywhere: 23.8 s under TCG on patagonia,
  24.3 s under TCG on CI's arm64 runner, 23.9 s under KVM on CI's x86_64 runner. Work that cost CPU
  would differ by the hosts' speed; this did not move with a 10x faster CPU.
- Byte timestamps show a quantum. Typing `echo hello world` echoed two characters per 0.10 s,
  and every write of a line's answer arrived 0.08 s after the last.
- A faster tick shrank it. `TICK_HZ` at 1000 instead of 100 (temporary, not committed) took the
  first boot from 488 s to 282 s and the second from 23.8 s to 4.5 s.

The cause is the last line of the x86_64 boot. After `x86_hand_over` the boot thread called
`arch::halt()`, `hlt` in a loop, while still a runnable thread on the run queue. Each time
round-robin reached it, the core stopped until the next 10 ms tick, with the shell, the console and
the input driver ready behind it. x86_64's input driver polls COM1 and yields (no COM1 interrupt
reaches userspace yet; `components/src/input.rs`), so the rotation reached the boot thread
constantly. The fix is that thread calling `sched::exit()` instead; the idle thread, which halts
only when nothing else can run, takes the core.

Why aarch64 and riscv64 never showed it is not measured. Their boot paths also end in
`arch::halt()`, but their input is interrupt-driven, so no thread keeps the rotation turning while
the shell waits. That is an inference from the code, not a measurement.

## Per-line seconds, one change at a time (patagonia, TCG, local)

The x86_64 leg alone (`script/swish-check --arch x86_64`, `NIFE_SHOW_LINE_TIMES=1`), on milestone
624's branch. Local runs skip the nine `std_exerciser` lines because the exerciser is not built
here, so they type 118 or 119 lines where CI types 128.

| change | first boot | per line | median | p90 | slowest | second boot (8 lines) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| none (624's branch) | 486.4 s / 119 | 4.09 s | 2.72 s | 7.93 s | 20.2 s | not reached (`wc < args.txt` failed) |
| `-cpu Skylake-Client` for `max` | 488.1 s / 118 | 4.14 s | 2.93 s | 7.68 s | 17.7 s | 23.8 s |
| `TICK_HZ` 1000 (diagnostic) | 282.0 s / 118 | 2.39 s | 1.23 s | 5.38 s | 14.2 s | 4.5 s |
| boot thread yields forever | 115.6 s / 118 | 0.98 s | 0.42 s | 2.39 s | 10.4 s | 1.1 s |
| boot thread exits (shipped) | 125.7 s / 118 | 1.07 s | 0.42 s | 2.29 s | 10.8 s | 0.9 s |
| exits, and no `intel-iommu` | 112.9 s / 118 | 0.96 s | 0.44 s | 2.16 s | 8.5 s | 1.0 s |

Medians and percentiles include the second boot's lines where it ran. One run each, so differences
of 10 percent are inside run-to-run noise: the yield and exit rows are the same result.

What each lead came to:

- The CPU model. `-cpu max` against a named model with `RDSEED`: no difference. Kept.
- The IOMMU. Dropping `intel-iommu` and `iommu_platform=on` moved 10 percent, inside the noise
  above, and would take away the confinement the kernel suite runs on this machine. Kept.
- The paint path. After the fix, the median line is 0.42 s and what is left is proportional to
  output: the `caps` lines and the two supervised jobs are the tail. The console still blocks on one
  paint per write because 624's batcher is off (`SCREEN_BATCHING_ENABLED`). That is 624's to finish,
  not this milestone's.
- The harness. It polls every 100 ms for the echo and the prompt, the same on every leg, and
  waits no fixed time. Not a lever.
- Acceleration. `swish_check` clears `NIFE_ACCEL` (since 2026-08-02, before the x86_64 leg
  existed) because HVF bought nothing on a leg that waits on QEMU's serial. The OVMF runner never
  read it. Under KVM on CI's x86_64 runner, before the fix, the leg was 358.4 s for 128 lines,
  2.8 s a line: KVM alone bought 2.7x because the time was ticks, not instructions.

## CI

| run | runner | leg | first boot | per line | second boot |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 37083676625 (624, reference) | arm64, TCG | x86_64 | 985.3 s / 128 | 7.7 s | 24.3 s |
| 37085722237 (628, KVM only) | x86_64, KVM | x86_64 | 358.4 s / 128 | 2.8 s | 23.9 s |
| 37089120726 (628, fix) | arm64, TCG | x86_64 | 364.5 s / 128 | 2.85 s | 2.0 s |
| 37089120726 (628, fix) | x86_64, KVM | x86_64 | 33.4 s / 128 | 0.26 s | 0.8 s |
| 37089120726 (628, fix) | arm64, TCG | aarch64 | 25.1 s / 131 | 0.19 s | 1.5 s |
| 37089120726 (628, fix) | arm64, TCG | riscv64 | 28.2 s / 131 | 0.22 s | 1.5 s |

With the fix and KVM, the x86_64 leg's median line is 0.10 s, the same as aarch64's and riscv64's.
Its slowest is `interrupt_ignorer` at 7.0 s, which is among the slowest lines on every leg (3.2 s on
aarch64) and is not looked into here. Under TCG on arm64 the fix alone takes the leg from 7.7 s a
line to 2.85 s, so KVM is worth a further 11x.

Job wall time, setup included: the reference `swish-check` job (all three legs) took 21m07s. Run
37085722237 (the split, before the fix) took 4m47s for the arm64 job's two legs. Run 37089120726
took 3m17s for `swish-check-x86_64`, and 10m17s for an arm64 job that ran all three legs as a
control. The two jobs run in parallel, so the check now costs the longer of about five minutes and
about three. That run printed line times (`NIFE_SHOW_LINE_TIMES`) from a commit that was dropped
before the branch was curated; the shipped workflow does not set it.

## Why main took 38 minutes and 624 took 21, when 624 saved 18 percent locally

On 2026-10-01 the leg took exactly 1942.0 s in two separate merge-group runs (36808011108 and
36815082049), to the tenth of a second. Wall time that repeats that closely is time the guest spent
waiting on its own clock, not time spent emulating. On a tick-paced leg, a change cuts wall time by
the ticks it removes, not by its instructions. So 624's saving on CI (1942 s to 985 s) and on
patagonia (6.3 s to 5.2 s a line, the 624 lane's figures) need not agree: the two hosts did not
spend their time on the same thing. Not measured further, because the fix removes the ticks.

## A gate for the next one

Milestone 722 (swish-check fails a leg that costs five times the others per line), provisional,
adds one. Nothing gated the cost of a leg for the two weeks the defect lasted, because the per-line bound is
sized to catch a hang and the job's wall time moves whenever a line is added. Each boot of 20 lines
or more now prints its median seconds a line beside its baseline, and fails above five times that
baseline (`LEG_COST_BASELINE` in `xtask/src/swish_check.rs`, with the CI runs each row came from). The
defect here was about 30 times its KVM row, so it fails; it was 2.7 times its TCG row, so under TCG
it would still pass. The rule compares a leg to its own history rather than to the other legs,
because x86_64 under TCG is legitimately fourteen times aarch64 under TCG.

## BUGS

- One run per row. The local table is single runs on a laptop that other lanes share.
- The aarch64 and riscv64 boots also end in `arch::halt()` on the boot thread
  (`kernel/src/lib.rs`), and nothing here shows whether they pay the same ticks. Their legs cost
  0.2 s a line, so the cost, if any, is small; not measured.
