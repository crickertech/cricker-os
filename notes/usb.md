# A USB keyboard: the xHCI driver and what it is allowed to touch

Milestone 242 (USB host and HID, because on commodity hardware the keyboard is not a UART). How a
key pressed on a USB keyboard reaches the shell, what each piece holds, and how to prove it works.

## The path a key takes

```text
USB keyboard ──► xHCI controller ──DMA, confined by the IOMMU──► usb_keyboard_driver (EL0)
                                                                   │ OPERATION_BYTES, CALL
                                                                   ▼
                                                              line_editor ──► swish
```

The driver diffs each eight-byte boot report against the last, turns the difference into Linux
evdev key codes (`crates/usb`'s `boot_keyboard`), and feeds those through `video_terminal::keymap`,
the same layout table the virtio keyboard uses. The bytes go to the line discipline's endpoint in
the framing `input` (the UART) already uses, so the shell cannot tell the two apart and both work at
once.

## Who does what

| Piece | Where | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| Find the controller, place its BAR, route its interrupt (MSI-X, MSI, or INTx) | `kernel/src/pci.rs`, `find_xhci_device` | config space |
| Take it from the PC firmware (USB Legacy Support), draw the register window, confine its DMA | `kernel/src/extensible_host_controller_interface.rs` | EL1 |
| What the driver is handed and refused | `kernel/src/user/usb_keyboard_service.rs` | the `Spawn` literal |
| Reset, rings, enumeration, the keyboard | `components/src/usb_keyboard_driver.rs` | EL0 |
| Descriptors, setup packets, boot reports | `crates/usb` | host-tested, Kani |
| Register window, handoff, TRBs, rings, contexts, `PORTSC` | `crates/extensible_host_controller_interface` | host-tested, Kani |
| Where the line discipline's endpoint comes from | `crates/system_initializer`, step 3b | the progenitor |

The kernel starts the driver before the progenitor and waits for its one bring-up report, which it
prints as the boot's `usb       :` line. The progenitor is granted the driver's attach endpoint at
slot 27 and sends `WRITE` on the terminal endpoint through it once the line discipline exists.

## The confinement, in one sentence

The driver holds every register page of its controller except the page its interrupt message is
programmed through, and its controller can reach nothing but its own DMA region. The first half is
`register_window` (a Kani harness proves no withheld page is ever mapped). The second is the IOMMU.
The kernel refuses to start the driver at all on a machine whose IOMMU does not confine the
controller, because a process holding an xHCI register file names every physical address the
controller reads.

## Proving it

`script/swish-check` boots each architecture a fourth time with `qemu-xhci` and `usb-kbd` attached
and nothing else that could type, presses `echo hello` through the QEMU monitor, and requires
`hello` back. The keyboard is full speed (`usb_version=1`), as real keyboards are. On x86_64 the
controller has MSI and no MSI-X (`msix=off,msi=on`), as xenon's Intel PCH controller does.

To boot one by hand:

```sh
NIFE_USB_KEYBOARD=1 NIFE_SCREEN_MON=/tmp/mon.sock helpers/qemu-bounded.sh 120 \
    helpers/qemu-runner-aarch64.sh target/aarch64-unknown-none-softfloat/debug/kernel
# in another terminal, once the prompt is up:
echo 'sendkey e' | nc -U /tmp/mon.sock
```

`NIFE_USB_KEYBOARD_OPTS` and `NIFE_USB_CONTROLLER_OPTS` are appended to the two `-device` options.

## The keystroke stall, and the wrong first diagnosis

Until 2026-10-05 (UTC) the riscv64 leg stalled mid-line about one boot in thirty: the echo of
`echo hello` stopped partway, and a byte typed on the UART released the held keys. This file's
BUGS blamed a lost wakeup of `line_editor` across harts. **That was wrong.** A thread dump at the
stall showed nobody sending to `line_editor`; the driver sat in `Irq::WAIT`, and its PLIC source
was pending, enabled, above threshold and undelivered.

QEMU's PLIC re-evaluates delivery on a priority, threshold or completion write and on a rising
line, never on an enable write, and `plic::enable` (which is also the driver's ACK) wrote the
priority first. An xHCI event raised while the driver was draining was stranded until another
device's line rose, a UART byte for instance. The fix writes the enable bit first;
`kernel/src/drivers/plic.rs` has the reasoning, and
`sched::tests::an_interrupt_raised_while_its_line_is_masked_is_delivered_at_the_ack` holds it on
all three architectures.

Measured on patagonia with the swish-check keystrokes alone (riscv64, TCG, four harts): 10 stalls in
300 boots with the old order, 0 in 300 with the fix. aarch64: 0 in 150. x86_64 was not counted.

## Per architecture

| | aarch64 | riscv64 | x86_64 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Under QEMU | INTx, SMMUv3; green | INTx, riscv-iommu; green | MSI (and MSI-X), VT-d; green |
| Real silicon | argon: not tried | radon: refused, no IOMMU | xenon: calef's bench step |

## BUGS

- Root ports only: a keyboard behind a hub is not found, and neither is a keyboard with a hub
  built into it. `crates/extensible_host_controller_interface`'s BUGS.
- One controller, one keyboard. The first xHCI on the bus, the first boot keyboard on it.
- No key repeat, no Caps Lock, no LEDs. `crates/usb`'s BUGS.
- No IOMMU, no USB keyboard. radon has none; a machine whose VT-d tables give the controller to
  a unit this kernel did not bring up gets the refusal line. This is the design, and it is a cost.
- A device refused after boot is refused silently: the report endpoint carries one message.
- Never run on silicon. Every number here is QEMU's: timeouts are the specification's limits,
  not measurements, and QEMU cannot model a low-speed device.
