# Registers

## What one physically is

A storage slot inside the CPU. Not in RAM, not on a memory stick. On the silicon of the
processor itself, nanometers from the arithmetic circuits that use it.

aarch64 has 31 of them, 64 bits each. 248 bytes. That is the entire amount of data the
CPU can hold at any one instant.

## The fact everything follows from

**The CPU cannot do arithmetic on memory. It can only do arithmetic on registers.**

`add x0, x1, x2` works because `x1` and `x2` are physically inside the processor, wired to
the adder. The result lands in `x0`, also inside the processor. No memory is involved.

To add two numbers that live in RAM you have no choice:

```asm
ldr x1, [x3]        ; pull a number in from memory
ldr x2, [x4]        ; pull the other one in
add x0, x1, x2      ; NOW you can add them
str x0, [x5]        ; push the answer back out
```

That is what "load/store architecture" means, and why `ldr`/`str` are the only instructions
that touch memory. Registers are the workbench. RAM is the warehouse. Nothing gets worked
on in the warehouse.

## Why only 31? They're absurdly expensive

Register speed is a physical fact about how far electricity has to travel.

| Where | Access cost | How much |
|---|---|---|
| **Register** | ~0 cycles (it's right there) | **248 bytes** |
| L1 cache | ~4 cycles | ~64 KB |
| L2 cache | ~14 cycles | ~1 MB |
| L3 cache | ~50 cycles | ~32 MB |
| **RAM** | **~200-300 cycles** | gigabytes |

A single trip to RAM costs a couple hundred cycles, during which the CPU could have run a
couple hundred instructions. Modern processors spend an enormous share of their design
budget on *not having to go to RAM*.

Adding more registers isn't free either: each costs die area, and naming one of 32 takes 5
bits inside a 32-bit instruction.

When the compiler "spills to the stack", this is what happened: more live values than
registers to hold them, so some got dumped to memory. Choosing what stays is register
allocation, one of the hardest problems a compiler solves.

## Registers have no types

`x0` is 64 bits. Integer? Pointer? `bool`? Float?

**The CPU has no idea and does not care.** It's 64 bits. The "type" exists entirely in the
mind of whoever wrote the code. `add` two pointers together and the hardware will
cheerfully do it.

Worth sitting with as a Rust person: every guarantee Rust gives evaporates at this level.
The borrow checker, the type system, `Option<T>` niche-optimized into a null pointer, all
of it is a fiction the compiler maintains *above* the hardware. Down here there are only
64-bit words. When we write `unsafe` in the kernel, we are stepping down to this layer,
where nothing is checked because there is nothing to check with.

## There's only one `x0`, and everyone wants it

Registers are global to the core. Every function uses `x0`. So how does `foo` call `bar`
without `bar` trashing what `foo` was holding?

By agreement. The aarch64 calling convention (AAPCS64):

| Registers | Role |
|---|---|
| `x0`–`x7` | function **arguments**; `x0` is the **return value**. Caller-saved: a callee may freely destroy them. |
| `x8`–`x18` | scratch. Also caller-saved. |
| `x19`–`x28` | **callee-saved.** To use `x19`, a function must save the old value and restore it before returning. |
| `x29` | frame pointer |
| `x30` | link register (return address) |

**None of this is enforced by hardware.** It is a convention, and it is the only reason
Rust and C code can call each other. It's also why `kernel_main` is declared `extern "C"`:
we're telling Rust "follow this exact agreement, because assembly is going to call you."

## The punchline

The register file *is* the CPU's state. All of it.

Capture all 31 general registers, plus `sp`, plus the program counter, plus a few status
bits, and you have completely described what the processor was doing. Every bit of "what
this program is in the middle of" lives in those ~300 bytes.

Which means: restore them and execution resumes as if nothing happened. The code cannot
detect that it was ever interrupted.

That is not an analogy. It is the literal mechanism behind three things:

- A context switch = save this thread's registers to memory, load another thread's
  registers from memory, `ret`. The CPU is now running a different thread. (Milestone 6.
  About thirty instructions.)
- An interrupt fires between any two instructions. The handler is about to use `x0`,
  but the interrupted code had something important in `x0`. So the handler saves every
  register, works, restores every register, returns. The interrupted code never knows time
  passed. (Milestones 2 and 5.)
- "A thread is a stack plus a set of register values" ([stack.md](stack.md)) was not a
  slogan. It is the complete and literal definition.

Everything in this operating system, from here to milestone 10, is some variation on
carefully saving and restoring 248 bytes.
