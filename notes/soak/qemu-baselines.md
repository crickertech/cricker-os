# The first QEMU soak measurements, and what a soak build costs

An appendix to [notes/soak.md](../soak.md). It holds the QEMU numbers of 2026-09-01 and 2026-09-02,
and the measurement of how far a `--features soak_test` build is from the one that ships.

## First measurements, 2026-09-01, patagonia, QEMU

These were taken with `script/soak --for 30s`, four groups per machine except x86. The x86 runner
defaulted to one core on the day; it defaults to two since 2026-09-23 (see the parent's BUGS). That
command is `script/soak-test` since 2026-09-14, from milestone 297 (`soak` becomes `soak-test`). The
name is left as it was typed here, and everywhere else that says how a number was taken, because how
a measurement was made is an account of a day.

These are QEMU numbers on a loaded laptop. They are a baseline for comparison, not a benchmark;
`script/bench` is the instrument for cost.

| Architecture | Cores | Workers | Round trips/s | Cross-core handoffs in 25s |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| aarch64 | 4 | 20 | ~58,000 | 17 |
| riscv64 | 4 | 20 | ~24,000 | 21 |
| x86_64 | 1 | 10 | ~3,900 | 0 |

## With the tick route, 2026-09-02, patagonia, QEMU (milestone 221 (the soak never crosses cores, so build the hook that makes it))

Same command, same host, one day later. These rows are not comparable with the rows above, for a
reason larger than the date: the build changed. Each pair below was measured back to back. The
"before" leg came from the exact commit this work branched from, on an otherwise idle machine. Each
was read at the 25-second beat (20 seconds on x86, whose beat count is lower).

| Architecture | Cores | Round trips before | after | Crossings before | after |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| aarch64 | 4 | 1,623,764 and 1,630,605 | 1,632,746 and 1,632,803 | 15, frozen from beat 1 | 1,452 and 3,779, both rising linearly |
| riscv64 | 4 | 871,047 and 886,428 | 662,787 and 823,783 | 10 and 14, frozen | 2,573 and 4,358, rising |
| x86_64 | 1 | 77,372 | 51,749 | 0 | 0, and one core is the whole reason |

There are two runs of each leg on the multicore architectures, because one would have been
misleading. The first pass of these measurements *was* misleading. It was taken while another lane's
test suite was running on the same laptop. The numbers it produced (aarch64 47,864 against 43,031 a
second) were the host's load rather than this change. Everything above is from an idle machine.

What the numbers support:

- aarch64 pays nothing measurable: 0.6% more round trips after than before, in the direction of
  faster, which is noise. The tick waiters complete no round trips. The set of workers that does is
  identical in both legs, so the totals are directly comparable.
- riscv64 pays about 7% on the closest-matched pair (886,428 against 823,783), and more on the
  looser one. It is the architecture where a migration costs the most under TCG, and it is the one
  crossing most often. So a cost showing up here and not on aarch64 is consistent rather than
  puzzling.
- x86_64 pays about a third, and that is arithmetic rather than a finding. Its runner was
  single-core on the day. So the two extra waiter threads are two more shares of the one core in a
  round-robin scheduler, and `crossings=0` is what one core means.

The round-trip rate fell far less than DECISIONS 138's spike saw. The spike reported about 30% on
aarch64 and about 55% on riscv64. That difference is recorded rather than explained away. The spike
was thrown away and cannot be re-measured, so why it was slower is not recoverable. The worker mix
is the obvious candidate, and it is a guess.

`wakes` and `crossings` are the two figures milestone 221 added, and neither is a throughput number.
The tick route wakes at `TICK_HZ` times the core count, which is a property of the machine rather
than of the workload. The crossings are however many of those wakes `wake_load_aware` chose to place
on another core. That is somewhere between a seventh and a half of them, varying by run more than by
architecture. That ratio is a fact about the placement policy under this load, and nothing in this
tree yet says what it should be.

## Which build these came from, and it is not the one that ships

Every figure above is from a `--features soak_test` kernel. That is the only build in which the
counters and `Thread::last_cpu` exist at all. It is not free, and the size of it is measured rather
than assumed:

| Architecture | `ipc_fastpath`, production | with `--features soak_test` | |
|---|---|---|---|
| aarch64 | 5,788 bytes | 6,120 | 1.06x |
| riscv64 | 5,106 bytes | 5,344 | 1.05x |
| x86_64 | 6,639 bytes | 6,995 | 1.05x |

So a soak build is not a production build. Its IPC path is five to six percent larger, and its
round-trip rates are therefore soak-build rates. Compare a soak number with another soak number,
which is what the three comparisons above are. Never compare one with `script/bench`, and never use
one as a statement about how fast this kernel does IPC.

Milestone 221 added nothing to that table, and it was checked rather than assumed. Its kernel change
is a `#[cfg(feature = "soak")]` call in `sched::on_tick` and a module that is not compiled otherwise.
So a production build should be untouched, and "should be" is what this tree does not accept. It was
built at the base commit and at the merge candidate, on all three architectures, without the
feature. Every symbol has the same size. Every section has the same size except `.strtab`, which is
not loaded. `ipc_fastpath` and `syscall_entry` are unchanged at 6,687 and 1,637 bytes.

The loadable image (`llvm-objcopy -O binary`) differs by 45 bytes on aarch64. All of them are
`core::panic::Location` line numbers below the insertion point, each larger by exactly the ten lines
added to that file. The proof is a rebuild of the base commit with ten comment lines at the same
point. It gives an image byte-for-byte identical to the merge candidate's, on all three
architectures. Any comment added to `sched.rs` would move those bytes. A hash comparison that called
that a change would be measuring the file's line count.

That the instrumentation is behind a feature at all is a thing this milestone got wrong first, and a
gate caught it. Shipping the counters and the `last_cpu` write unconditionally put `ipc_fastpath`
5.7% over the 5% bound of milestone 132 (fast) on aarch64 (5,788 -> 6,120). riscv64 and x86_64 grew
4.7% and 4.6% behind it: one cause, three effects, and aarch64 merely the one that tipped. The
`last_cpu` write sits in `schedule()`'s switch, the hottest line of the hottest function.
`script/lint` now runs clippy on `--features soak_test` on both ISAs, because a `cfg`-gated
instrument that nothing lints is one that rots. The first run of that check found two real warnings
in `kernel/src/soak.rs`, which had never been linted.
