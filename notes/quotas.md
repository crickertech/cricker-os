# Per-process resource quotas

The security audit's one remaining userspace-reachable attack was **resource exhaustion**: a
process that spawns children without limit, or spawns children that block forever, makes the
kernel allocate a `Thread`, a 16 KiB kernel stack, and an address space per child, with no bound.
Untyped memory (milestone 11) bounds a process's *pages*, but not the kernel objects behind a
spawn. This is the bound for those.

## The idea, and why it needs no bookkeeping

A spawner is given a **quota**: at most N children alive at once. The clever part is *when* a slot
comes back. It is not a timer, not a scan, not a reference count the kernel has to maintain. The
slot is a value that lives inside the child's `Thread`, and Rust's ownership returns it at
exactly the right moment:

```rust
pub struct QuotaToken(&'static AtomicU32);
impl Drop for QuotaToken {
    fn drop(&mut self) { self.0.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed); }
}
```

Reserving a slot is one atomic decrement (a compare-exchange loop that never dips below zero). The
`QuotaToken` holding that reservation is a field of the spawned `Thread`. When the reaper drops a
finished thread, the token drops with it and the slot returns. So:

- A child that exits frees its slot the instant it is reaped. A well-behaved workload never
  touches the limit: the shell ran ten `run` commands back to back under a budget of eight, with
  zero refusals, because each worker exited and returned its slot before the next was asked for.
- A child that blocks forever (on an endpoint nobody drains, an interrupt that never fires)
  keeps holding its slot, which is exactly right: it is still consuming a thread, a stack, and an
  address space. The budget counts *live* children, and a leaked child is a live child.

This is the same ownership-does-the-work pattern the `KernelStack` and `AddressSpace` already use
(the reaper's `drop` frees them). The quota just adds one more thing that rides the thread's
lifetime.

## What it bounds

`sched::spawn_with_quota(&BUDGET, closure)` returns `None` when the budget is spent or the
kernel is out of memory: the caller cannot tell the two apart and does not need to. The shell's
process service used a budget of eight (`shell_service::SPAWN_QUOTA`) and, on `None`, reported "could
not spawn a process" to the shell rather than panicking (the audit's other spawn finding). So a
spawn flood, or a pile of workers that block and never exit, was capped at eight live children:
eight threads, eight stacks, eight address spaces, and no more. Kernel memory from spawning was
bounded, per spawner, for the first time.

## Where this stands today (corrected 2026-07-30, milestone 41)

The mechanism is in the kernel and nothing calls it. Its one caller was the kernel-wired
`shell_service`'s spawn service, which DECISIONS §28 retired and milestone 41 deleted; `Thread.quota`
is `None` on every thread that exists. That is not a regression, because the bound moved: a
userspace process spawns out of its own untyped budget (§10, §16), so the budget *is* the quota and
retyping enforces it instead of a counter. What remains uncovered is a *kernel* thread spawned in a
loop by something untrusted, and nothing does that.

`spawn_with_quota` is kept rather than deleted, with the disposition written on the function
(DECISIONS §38), because removing a documented safety mechanism is a design decision and not
dead-code cleanup. The rest of this note describes the mechanism as designed; read it that way.

## What it is not

It is a per-spawner quota, and when it had a caller there was exactly one spawner (the shell's
service), so it was a per-process quota for the process that mattered. Generalizing to many spawners is a table of
counters instead of one static, not a new idea. And it bounds *spawns*; it does not bound every
kind of kernel object a future syscall might create. The complete answer is still the
untyped-kernel-objects model (a process's entire kernel footprint drawn from its own untyped, as
seL4 does), where a `Thread` and its stack are retyped from untyped exactly as pages are in
milestone 11. This quota is the pragmatic bound that closes the reachable exhaustion vector now;
untyped kernel objects are the principled version, still ahead.
