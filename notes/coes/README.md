# Corrections of error

*Name: provisional. `coes` and this directory were minted by the maintainer session on 2026-09-30
(UTC) for calef's commission; the abbreviation spells out above and is his to ratify or rename.*

When the machine or a sweep overrules how the tree was being run, the correction is recorded
here, one file per error, dated UTC. A correction follows §210 (a correction of error, and its
action items are decisions, proposals or milestones). It has what happened, one timeline with
times, the impact, and a five whys section rooted at the problem as the affected party saw it.
Where the first answer splits into independent causes, each branch is followed to its own fifth
why. Then the root cause, and the action items that replace it. Each why is answered from evidence.

The action items are one `## Action items` section, a bullet each, opening with the `## Follow-on`
vocabulary: `**Milestone N.**`, `**Proposed.**` naming its file, `**Decision.**` naming its file,
or `**Done.**`, `**Recorded.**` or `**Refused.**` with what carried it. `**None.**` is refused,
since an error with no mechanism under it is a prediction of its own recurrence.
`script/roadmap --check` fails an item that resolves to nothing, and `--coe-actions` lists the
open ones. `script/metrics` charts the open count each week so it can be driven down
(helpers/coe_actions.py, calef's review of #1513). An item is open while the milestone, proposal or
decision it names is not done.

This index holds one line each; the detail lives in the files.

- [2026-09-30: lane follow-through lived in memory](2026-09-30-lane-follow-through.md): five
  unexecuted maintainer endings in one session, and the PENDING-at-dispatch contract that replaced
  remembering them.
- [2026-10-03: the merge rate fell](2026-10-03-the-merge-rate.md): a CI job that doubled and a
  queue that ejected 43% of its entries slowed every merge for a week. Then a weekly usage limit
  stopped the work, about 190 merges were deferred, and nothing read either signal.
- [2026-10-03: the queue's helpers judged one pull request at a time](2026-10-03-the-queue-judged-one-pull-request-at-a-time.md):
  the drain re-queued what a person had dequeued, the pre-push hook outran the agents' timeouts, and
  33 group builds failed on facts only the merged tree could make true.
