# The 2026-10-03 census's survivors, part three

Milestone 637 (triage the crates the 2026-09-21 mutation census measured for the first time),
provisional number, 2026-10-03. Parts [one](census-2026-10-03-triage.md) and
[two](census-2026-10-03-triage-part-2.md) hold the method and the first crates. Every number here is
`script/mutation -p <crate>` on the lane's worktree against the same run,
[37108924347](https://github.com/nifeos/nife/actions/runs/37108924347).

## grant_plan

48 missed: 38 killed, 10 equivalent. The sweep afterwards reports 10 missed.

- The const-evaluated checks (13). `all_distinct_ids`, `all_distinct_names` and `same_bytes` guard
  the program table at compile time and had never been run on a case they refuse. Duplicates are now
  placed at each pair of positions, and strings are compared at equal length with one byte
  different.
- `Flags::try_new` (3). Exactly sixteen letters are allowed, seventeen are not, and a repeated
  letter is refused wherever it sits.
- `image_can_carry` (3). A `std` image is carriable at the baseline and refused for each of
  non-byte output, a memory grant, a domain and the network, one at a time. A mutated `&&` turns
  one refusal into an acceptance only when the others hold, which is why each variant removes just
  one allowance.
- Sizes and sentinels (9). `STD_REGION_PAGES`, `image_region_pages`, `SHELL_BUDGET_PAGES`, the
  spawn sentinels (distinct, and all within eight of `u64::MAX`), and `UNVOUCHED_STD_MANIFEST`'s
  runtime field.
- `check_words` (4). A line that fills the argument page exactly is taken and one byte more is not.
  Two 1,100-byte words fit, which separates the cost of a word (bytes plus four) from four times
  its bytes.
- `is_quoted` at the last slot, `SecondDir::mount`, and a directory kept with its name when a
  smaller name is sorted in front of it (`keep_smallest`) (3).
- `Designation::is_here`, and `NameSet::last` of an empty set (2).

The 10 equivalents:

- `|` as `^` in `WordGrant::rights` (5): the rights bits are disjoint. `1 << 0` as `1 >> 0` (2).
- `while i < ids.len()` as `<=` in the two distinctness checks (2): at `i == len` the inner loop has
  nothing to compare, so the extra pass does no work.
- `keep_smallest`'s `>` as `>=` (1): it differs only for two equal names, and a directory lists a
  name once.

## paging

45 missed: 2 killed, 43 equivalent. The sweep afterwards reports 43 missed.

- Killed (2): `Ia32e::leaf_flags`'s `entry & SW_KERNEL_EXEC != 0`, read as an OR or an XOR, would make
  every supervisor leaf executable. A leaf without the software bit is now checked to be data or
  read-only data, and the same leaf with it to be code.
- Equivalent, `|` as `^` (37): every page-table entry is built by OR-ing an address (masked to its
  own bit range) with flag bits that each sit in a position of their own. This covers the aarch64,
  Sv39, `Ia32e` and VT-d entries and the capability-flag constructors, and no pair shares a bit.
- Equivalent, a shift of zero (6): `1 << 0` as `1 >> 0` and `0b00 << 6` as `0b00 >> 6` are the same
  number.

The OR group is the largest single block of equivalents in the census. Each would stop being
equivalent if the flag words were built from a type that refused overlap, which `Flags` is not
(it holds a raw capability word). Nothing in this tree needs that, so it is a note and not a
proposal.

## walk_pricing

38 missed: 30 killed, 7 equivalent, 1 recorded gap. The sweep afterwards reports 8 missed.

The crate's own test only checked that a priced walk had the right shape. Nothing checked a number.

- `Split::total`, `totals_line` and the two per-unit prices (22). Each is pinned on inputs chosen so
  every operator differs: powers of two for the split, and for the prices a difference of 7 per
  entry over 127 entries and 3 per KiB over 252.
- `median_ns` (2). The closure runs once untimed and `REPS` times, and a 2 ms sleep reads back as at
  least 2 ms.
- `price`'s chain loop (2). A tree whose deepest file is missing is an error. A loop that never
  descended would read the shallow file over and over and report success.
- `walk_split`'s accumulators (2). Open and close time are each positive over the whole tree.

The 7 equivalents are `slope`'s, and they are algebra. A least-squares slope is the sum of
`(x - mean x)(y - mean y)` over the sum of `(x - mean x)^2`. The mean of `y` drops out because
`(x - mean x)` sums to zero, so `y - my` as `y + my`, and `my` as anything, change nothing. The
same identity makes `(x + mx)(x - mx)` sum to the same variance as `(x - mx)^2`, and `(x + mx)(y -
my)` the same covariance. `median_ns`'s `REPS / 2` as `REPS % 2` is the seventh: they are both 1 for
`REPS = 3`.

The gap is `price`'s `WHOLE_REPS / 2`, which is 2 and as `%` is 1. It picks which of five sorted
timings is called the median, and a test can only assert it on a clock it controls.

## system_log

33 missed: 29 killed, 4 equivalent. The sweep afterwards reports 4 missed.

- Control words (14). Each of the four ops is refused for badge 0, and each is refused one past the
  argument or field it accepts. A valid word is not counted as a refusal. The refused counter is
  checked after every word, so an op that was half-applied would show.
- `handle` and `ingest` (6). A message of another kind is counted each time. `ingest` was never
  called by any test: a record handed straight to the store is held, numbered by the service and
  read back, and `held` counts them.
- `Ring` (7). An entry that exactly fills the ring evicts nothing and the next evicts exactly one
  (64-byte entries, 1,024 of them), the entry header is 11 bytes, a dropped line counts from the
  reader's cursor, a per-user read matches the whole name and not a prefix, and a window that
  holds a line exactly takes it.
- `Assembler` (2) and `json` (2). The writer cut is the least recently heard from, an idle slot
  is taken without an empty cut line, and `\n` and `\r` use their short escapes.

The 4 equivalents: `Ring`'s three `% RING_BYTES` as `+` (the head and the read position grow past
the buffer, but every access wraps again, so the bytes read are the same), and `control`'s
`arg < 2` as `<=` on `OP_NAME` (the registry refuses the third name chunk itself).
