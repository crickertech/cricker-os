# Threads, the context switch, and preemption

Milestone 6. The thing the whole project has been arguing about since before a line of it
existed.

## A thread is a stack plus a set of register values

From [registers.md](registers.md), milestone 1:

> That is not a metaphor. It is the complete and literal definition.

And here it is, written down:

```rust
pub struct Thread {
    pub id: Tid,
    pub state: State,
    pub context: *mut Context,     // <- 8 bytes. The ENTIRE saved CPU state.
    pub stack: Option<KernelStack>,
}
```

A suspended thread's whole CPU state is one stack pointer. Everything else: the registers,
the return address, the frame pointer: is sitting on the stack it points at, pushed there by
`switch_to`. Eight bytes.

## The context switch is fifteen instructions

```asm
switch_to:                      // x0 = &prev.context,  x1 = next.context
    sub  sp, sp, #96
    stp  x19, x20, [sp, #0]     // push OUR callee-saved registers
    ...
    stp  x29, x30, [sp, #80]

    mov  x2, sp
    str  x2, [x0]               // prev.context = sp    <- the whole of "saving a thread"

    mov  sp, x1                 // and now we are on somebody else's stack

    ldp  x19, x20, [sp, #0]     // pop THEIR callee-saved registers
    ...
    ldp  x29, x30, [sp, #80]
    add  sp, sp, #96

    ret                         // <- returns into a DIFFERENT THREAD
```

The last instruction is the trick. `ret` jumps to `x30`, and by that point `x30` has been
loaded from the *other thread's* stack. So it does not return to the caller. It resumes a
different thread, at the point where that thread last called `switch_to`, possibly seconds
ago.

A context switch is a function call that returns somewhere else.

### Why only twelve registers, when the trap frame saves thirty-three

`vectors.s` saves all 31 general registers, because an exception lands between two
arbitrary instructions and the interrupted code has no idea.

`switch_to` is an ordinary function call. AAPCS64 already says the caller must assume
`x0`–`x18` are destroyed by any call it makes: the compiler has already spilled anything it
cared about. So we save only what the convention promises a callee will preserve: `x19`–`x28`,
`x29` (frame pointer), `x30` (link register), and `sp`.

That isn't an optimization we invented. It falls out of the calling convention, and it is why
real kernels have both a trap frame *and* a much cheaper voluntary switch.

(And no floating-point registers, because the kernel is `softfloat`: a decision made at
milestone 1 for a completely unrelated reason. `d8`–`d15` simply do not appear.)

## Starting a thread that has never run

A new thread has no saved registers to restore. So we fake them: write a `Context` onto the
fresh stack with `x30` pointing at `thread_trampoline`.

Which means the very same `ret` that *resumes* an existing thread also *starts* a new one.
There is no separate first-run path. The trampoline just happens to be what `x30` points at.

The closure travels in `x19`: a callee-saved register, chosen precisely because `switch_to`
restores it on the way in.

> `Box<dyn FnOnce()>` is a fat pointer (data + vtable), two words, and we have one register.
> So box it twice: `Box<Box<dyn FnOnce()>>` is a *thin* pointer to a fat one, and fits.

### The trampoline must unmask interrupts, but AFTER `finish_switch`, not before

A brand-new thread must unmask interrupts by hand: we arrive from inside the timer IRQ handler (or
a `schedule()` that ran there), IRQs masked, and unlike a *resumed* thread there is no `SPSR_EL1`
to restore the interrupt state from: the thread was never interrupted, it has never run at all.
Without unmasking, the first thread you spawn runs with interrupts masked forever, never preempted:
a cooperative scheduler with extra steps.

The trap, and a real intermittent hang it caused (found by a watchdog dumping thread states, see
notes/deadlock.md): the trampoline first called `thread_entry`, whose first act is `finish_switch`,
and it unmasked interrupts before that call. `finish_switch` reaps the predecessor and completes
any wake it deferred, by reading this core's `switched_from`. If a timer IRQ lands between an early
unmask and `finish_switch`, it runs `schedule()`, which overwrites `switched_from` with the fresh
thread: the predecessor is stranded. Its `on_cpu` never clears, so every future wake for it is
deferred forever (`wake_pending` set, never completed). It blocks on some later IPC and never wakes.

So the ordering is load-bearing:

```asm
thread_trampoline:
    // NO early unmask here.
    bl   thread_entry          // finish_switch() runs FIRST, masked
```
```rust
extern "C" fn thread_entry(...) {
    finish_switch();                       // masked: nothing can overwrite switched_from
    crate::arch::interrupts::enable();      // NOW unmask; the closure is preemptible
    call(closure);
}
```

For a user thread the unmask is even freer: `finish_switch` runs masked, and the `eret` that
drops to EL0 restores an `SPSR` with IRQs on, so the EL0 thread is preemptible from its first
instruction with no explicit `enable`. Same rule either way: `finish_switch` runs masked. The
general statement is that the whole switch, from `schedule` masking IRQs to the successor's
`finish_switch` completing, is one atomic region; a fresh thread's entry is inside that region and
must not open it early.

## Preemption is four lines, because milestone 2 did the hard part

At the bottom of the IRQ handler:

```rust
gic::end_of_interrupt(intid);

if sched::take_need_resched() {
    sched::schedule();          // <- may not return here for a long time
}
```

We're still on the interrupted thread's kernel stack, with its full TrapFrame sitting below
us: `vectors.s` saved it before Rust ever ran.

`schedule()` may switch to another thread entirely. When it does, that call does not return
here. It returns *in some other thread*. We come back only when somebody schedules us again,
and then `exception_restore` pops the TrapFrame and `eret` resumes the instruction we
interrupted, **which never knew any of this happened.**

That is the whole of preemption. The register-saving machinery already existed, built at
milestone 2 for exception handling, with no thought of threads.

Note the EOI comes first. Switching away with the interrupt unacknowledged would leave the
GIC refusing to deliver anything of equal or lower priority to the thread we switch *to*.

## Three rules, and each is a bug if you get it wrong

1. Release the run-queue lock BEFORE switching. Switch away holding it and the lock is now
held by a thread that is not running. The next thread to want it spins forever, waiting for a
thread that can only be scheduled by taking the lock. A deadlock that would take a day to find.

2. Interrupts stay masked across the switch. Between "I decided to switch" and "I switched"
there must be no window for the timer to decide *again*.

And the saved interrupt state is a local, on this thread's stack, which is exactly what
makes it work. When somebody eventually switches back to us, `switch_to` returns into
`schedule()`, and that frame, with the right `was_enabled` in it, is still sitting where we left
it.

**3. A thread cannot free the stack it is standing on.** `exit()` marks itself `Finished` and
calls `schedule()`. The next thread reaps it, once we are safely off it. Every kernel has
something called a reaper, and this is why.

## The address-space leak that hid behind a two-frame test failure

The reaper test failed with two frames leaked, not thirty-two. So the stacks *were* being
freed.

The two were page tables. The stack area is a fresh region of virtual address space, so the
first `map_page` there had to build an L2 and an L3. And `unmap_page` frees the leaf mapping but
leaves the intermediate tables standing (the TODO on `paging::unmap`).

Which exposed a real leak hiding behind it: stack virtual addresses were **bump-allocated and
never reused**. Threads come and go, but every 2 MiB of address space ever consumed keeps its
page tables forever.

The fix is a free list of dead threads' address ranges, so a new thread lands in page tables that
already exist. There is now a test asserting that a second batch of eight threads costs
exactly zero additional frames.

## The test

```rust
sched::spawn(|| {
    while !STOP.load(Relaxed) {
        SPINNING.fetch_add(1, Relaxed);
        // Deliberately nothing else. No yield. No syscall. Not even a function call.
    }
});
```

From [DECISIONS](../design/decisions/05-preemptive-threads.md) §5, written before any of this existed:

> A userspace process is an arbitrary ELF binary. It has its own stack, **it never yields**, and
> it will loop forever because we will write a bug. Under cooperative scheduling, one bad user
> program hangs the machine permanently.

Under async/await, or Go before 1.14, or any cooperative runtime, that thread takes the CPU and
never gives it back. The **only** thing that can take it back is a timer interrupt landing
between two instructions of that loop and switching the stack out from under it.

At boot:

```
  half a second later, having spawned two threads that NEVER yield:

    thread 1 (hostile) :    3304328 iterations
    thread 2 (polite)  :    3133498 iterations
    preemptions        :         48

  neither asked to be interrupted. both were.
```

The argument was right, and the kernel can host untrusted code.
