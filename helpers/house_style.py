"""The house-style ratchet: British spellings and imperial units, counted, and never allowed to grow.

calef, 2026-10-06 (UTC), two rulings on the same morning:

    "Lets standardize on American because I'm American."
    "Lets also standardize on metric measures, because imperial is stupid."

The tree's prose and names use American spelling, and its measurements are metric. Neither was
ruled before, and the tree had drifted British: on the ruling's day this counted 3,946 British
forms (2,134 in Markdown, 1,812 in code and configuration) and 5 imperial quantities. A sweep in
batches drives the counts to zero (the batch plan is in the pull request that landed this, #1735);
this gate makes sure nothing new arrives while it does. It is rung 2 of the AGENTS.md ladder. The
rule's record is a dated amendment to §213 (writing standards) and design/naming.md's spelling
section.

    python3 helpers/house_style.py --check      # what script/lint runs
    python3 helpers/house_style.py --list [PATH..]  # every counted hit, path:line: word
    python3 helpers/house_style.py --bank       # lower CEILINGS to the tree; never raises
    python3 helpers/house_style.py --selftest   # the traps, as fixtures

Name: provisional, minted by lane/american-spelling on 2026-10-06. A shared python module under
`helpers/`, which `script/names` puts out of its own scope, so its provenance is this paragraph.
calef names things; expect this to change.

**Two halves, the prose ratchet's shape.** A count over its ceiling in `CEILINGS` fails, which is
what guards `main`, where there is no merge base. A branch is also held to its merge base: summed
over the files it changed, no category may grow. That second half is the real ratchet. With
thousands of hits, ordinary edits delete British words all the time, and a ceiling alone would let
the next change spend that slack. Below the ceiling is silent, on purpose: failing there too (the
`agents-md-lines` shape) would fail every unrelated change that happened to delete a line with
one of these words in it. `--bank` lowers the ceilings, and each sweep batch runs it.

**British spelling is counted by `typos --locale en-us`**, the checker the spelling gate already
runs, so the word list is VarCon's (maintained upstream, a few thousand pairs) rather than one
written here. `typos` splits identifiers, so `FATAL_RISK_COLOURS` counts as a name: the ruling
covers names. `EXTRA_BRITISH` adds the forms VarCon leaves alone but American usage does not use.
`NOT_BRITISH` removes the two VarCon flags that American dictionaries accept as they stand.

**Imperial units are counted by regular expression**, and only as quantities: a unit word must
follow a number (digits, a number word, `a`, `an`, `half`), so "under the caller's feet", "foot
gun" and "the last mile" are idiom, not measurement. An abbreviation (`ft`, `lb`, `oz`, `yd`,
`mi`, `gal`) must follow digits. Of the inch marks only the double prime counts: a `"` after
digits closes a quoted string here (`"core 3"`) far more often than it measures anything. `in` is
never read as inches; "1 in 10" is far more common here than a length.

**Permanent exclusions, each correct for a stated reason, not a backlog:**

- A Markdown blockquote line (`>`). It is a quotation, and a quotation keeps its source's words,
  the em-dash gate's precedent (calef, 2026-09-22). An inline quotation still counts: put it on
  its own `>` line. Matching quotation marks instead lets anyone past by quoting themselves.
- An external name or title, in `EXTERNAL_NAMES`: a vulnerability's name, a paper's title. Each
  entry carries where it comes from. Add one only for a name somebody else coined.
- A URL, which is somebody else's address.
- An industry designation that is a product name rather than a measurement, in `DESIGNATIONS`:
  a 3.5-inch drive bay, a 19-inch rack, a screen's diagonal class. A metric gloss is welcome.
- Data files (`.csv`, `.tsv`, `.svg`): each is generated from the tree, so it follows its source,
  or records a past fact (a CI job's name on a date), which a sweep must not rewrite.
- Trees that are somebody else's text, as `_typos.toml` already excludes them: `vendor/`,
  `patches/`, lockfiles, `target/`, and board transcripts (`bench/**/*.log`).
- This file, which has to spell the words it counts.

**At zero, this file retires.** `locale = "en-us"` in `_typos.toml` then makes the spelling gate
reject British forms outright, the extras move into its `extend-words`, and the units half stays
here or moves to its own gate. That is a rung up from a counted ratchet to an outright refusal.

BUGS:
- VarCon is a dictionary, not a judgment about this tree. It flags a few words an American writer
  would accept (`NOT_BRITISH` holds the ones found so far) and misses some British ones
  (`EXTRA_BRITISH`). Both lists grow as the sweep meets cases.
- The imperial half reads quantities by pattern, so "a pound of" in a recipe-style idiom would
  count and "six-foot" written without its number would not, and `12"` for twelve inches is not
  read at all. None of the three occurred on the ruling's day.
