"""The inflow check: a survivor a merged pull request adds on its own lines must have a triage row.

Milestone 740 (the survivors a merged pull request adds are checked against a triage record), provisional number minted by the mutation-inflow-check lane on 2026-10-04 UTC: calef's
ruling "Yes, build the inflow check" (2026-10-04 UTC) on fatal risk 3, spec in
notes/mutation-testing/inflow-2026-10-03.md. Before this, nothing could say whether the survivors each
merged pull request adds were triaged; `script/mutation --report` prints per-crate totals and the
triage ledgers are prose.

    python3 helpers/mutation_inflow.py check --census DATE --run ID --sha SHA \\
        --survivors-dir notes/project-metrics/mutation-survivors \\
        --triage notes/project-metrics/mutation-triage.csv \\
        --snapshot-out OUT.csv.gz [--summary FILE] SHARD_DIR...
    python3 helpers/mutation_inflow.py snapshot --census DATE --run ID --sha SHA --out OUT SHARD_DIR...
    python3 helpers/mutation_inflow.py --selftest      # fixtures, no git, no network; script/lint

`check` reads one census's `missed.txt` shard files, diffs them against the latest committed survivor
list that is older than this census, blames each new survivor's line to the commit and merged pull
request that wrote it, and looks the survivor up in the triage CSV. Exit 0: every inflow survivor has a
row. Exit 1: some do not, and they are listed with crate, function, mutation and pull request. Exit 2:
bad input. It never blocks a pull request: it runs in the weekly workflow only, because milestone 479
(a blocking `--in-diff` mutation gate) stays refused.

THE KEY. A survivor is `(crate, function, mutation)`, never a line number, because lines move and a
triage row written on Tuesday must still match on Monday. cargo-mutants names a mutant
`path:line:col: replace < with <= in Type::fn`. The crate is the path component before `/src/`. The
function is what follows the last ` in ` when that tail holds no ` with `; a function-body replacement
(`replace Foo::bar -> u64 with 0`) has no ` in `, so its function is the name after `replace` and its
mutation is the whole text; a constant's operator (`replace | with ^`, no enclosing function) has
function empty. Two mutants with one key (the same operator swapped on two lines of one function) share
a row, and a row covers all of them. The crate is resolved through
notes/project-metrics/mutation-census-renames.csv on both sides of every comparison, so a renamed crate
is not a vanished one with a new one beside it.

WHAT COUNTS AS INFLOW. A key is new when this census holds more mutants under it than the previous
census did. A new key is **inflow** when at least one of its current lines was last written by a commit
that is not an ancestor of the previous census's commit; that commit's merged pull request is blamed.
A new key whose every line predates the previous census is **unattributed**: no pull request wrote it
in the window, so it is the work of something else (a mutant the tool did not generate before, a test
that was deleted, a shard lost from the previous census). Unattributed keys are reported and counted,
never failed, because failing a job on a cause nobody can act on teaches people to ignore it.

BUGS

- A key with several lines is judged by its newest line, so a pull request that adds a third copy of an
  operator pattern to a function already holding two triaged ones is covered by the existing row. The
  row's reason is the place to say so; the check cannot.
- The blame is at the census's own commit (`--sha`), by `git blame`, so a line a later refactor moved
  between files is attributed to the move, as it is everywhere in this tree.
- Pull request lookup is `gh api commits/SHA/pulls`. A commit with no pull request (a direct push) is
  named by its abbreviated hash.
- A census with fewer than eight shards is not diffed: a lost shard reads as a crate that got better
  and then worse. The workflow decides that, not this module.
