# helpers/open-question.jq: does a pull request or issue hold a question for calef that no ruling
# has answered yet?
#
# lane/architect-queue, 2026-10-06 (UTC). calef: "I need a reliable work queue just like your
# agents." His queue is the `needs-architect` label, and that day it failed both ways: #1783 kept the
# label after he had ruled ("But the label says that the PR needs my attention"), and #1745 changed
# the syscall surface without it. The invariant this file makes checkable: an item carries
# `needs-architect` if and only if it has an open question. Two readers splice it in front of their
# own program, the way helpers/queue-eligible.jq is spliced (jq cannot compose `-f` with an inline
# program): helpers/needs-maintainer.jq's three architect causes, and script/architect-queue.
#
# An ASK is a `## What I need from you` heading (the decisions skill's convention; `###` too) at the
# start of a line, in a comment or in the body. The body counts from the item's creation, since
# GitHub records no time for a body edit. A section whose first line is just "Nothing." or "None."
# (#1651) asks nothing. A heading quoted mid-line in backticks, as the labelers' own comments do, is
# not an ask.
#
# A RULING closes every ask older than it. It is any of:
#   - a comment carrying `<!-- architect-ruling -->`, which script/record-ruling writes;
#   - a comment with a `## Ruling` or `## Sent back` heading, the hand-written forms of 2026-10-06
#     (#1781, #1785, #1786, #1783);
#   - `architect-ruled` or `held-by-lane` being applied, which is how every older ruling was
#     recorded.
# `<!-- architect-ruling partial -->` (script/record-ruling --partial) and a `## Partial ruling`
# heading are records that close nothing.
#
# The input is a node in the shape helpers/merge-drain.sh's `NM_QUERY` asks for: `body`,
# `createdAt`, `url`, `comments.nodes[] {createdAt, url, body}` and `labelEvents.nodes[] {createdAt,
# label {name}}`. A missing field reads as empty, so an older fixture has no ask.
#
# BUGS
#   - A hand-written `## Ruling on Fork 1` closes the forks still unruled beside it (#1785 ruled two
#     forks in two comments). Use `script/record-ruling --partial` for all but the last.
#   - A comment that rules and asks again at once counts as a ruling: the ask is not newer than it.
#     Ask in a comment of its own.
#   - A body edited to add an ask after a ruling is not seen. Ask in a comment.
#   - Only the newest 30 comments and 20 label events are read (the query's window). An ask older
#     than that on a busy pull request is missed.
