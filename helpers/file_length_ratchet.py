"""The file-length ratchet: §266 (a Rust source file stays under 2,000 lines), held to a baseline
that only falls.

Milestone 841 (a ratchet on Rust file length, and its dashboard row). calef ruled §266 on
2026-10-08 (UTC): the measure, the 2,000-line ceiling, the goals, and option (b) for the gate's
matching rule, a list entry that is a ceiling and only falls. This is that gate, and it copies
`helpers/prose_ratchet.py`'s pattern, §212 (a prose budget)'s ratchet, on purpose: a committed
list that only shrinks, a comparison against the merge base, and a selftest that runs before the
check.

    python3 helpers/file_length_ratchet.py --check          # what script/lint runs
    python3 helpers/file_length_ratchet.py --bank           # lower the baseline to the tree; never raises
    python3 helpers/file_length_ratchet.py --selftest       # the rules, as fixtures
    python3 helpers/file_length_ratchet.py --init           # write the baseline from scratch (milestone 841 only)

Name: provisional, minted by milestone 841's lane on 2026-10-08. A shared python module under
`helpers/`, which `script/names` puts out of its own scope, so its provenance is this paragraph
rather than a `Name:` block. calef names things; expect this to change. Refused
`file_size_ratchet`: §266 names a count of lines, and `file size` belongs to the dashboard series
`script/metrics` keeps (`notes/project-metrics/file-size.csv`), which measures the tree rather
than policing it.

**The measure.** A file's size is its physical line count, `wc -l`: comments, blank lines and
inline `mod tests` counted, exactly §266 section 1. A reader or a model opening a file loads every
line of it, and in this tree the comments are 41% of the non-blank Rust, so a measure that skipped
them would hide most of what the reader pays. Every tracked `.rs` file outside `vendor/`, plus
untracked ones, so a lane's new file is judged before its first commit. A file of 2,000 lines is
allowed; 2,001 is over.

**The rules** (§266 section 3, option (b), ruled by calef over exact match):

- A file not on the list fails at 2,001 lines or more. A new file is not on the list.
- A listed file fails if it grew against the merge base, and if it is larger than its entry. The
  growth check is unconditional: an entry can sit above its file's real size because a shrink was
  never banked, and that slack is not room to grow back into.
- A list entry is a ceiling that `--bank` lowers and nothing raises. An entry fails when its file
  is gone, renamed, at or under 2,000 lines, or larger than the entry, so dead rows cannot
  accumulate.
- Against the merge base, a row may not be added and an entry may not rise. A rename moves its row
  in the same change, at the same number.
- Exceptions are not provided for. A file that must stay over 2,000 lines needs §266 amended, by
  an architect.

**Why a ceiling and not exact match** (§266 section 3, the measurement that argued it): 164 of the
664 merges in the fortnight to 2026-10-08 touched a listed file, so under exact match two
shrinking changes to one file in one merge group each write a different number on the same row and
the group fails even when the Rust merged cleanly. Under option (b) both pass; the cost is that an
entry can sit above its file's real size until someone banks it. The dashboard row reads the tree,
never the list, so that staleness reaches no number anyone quotes.

**The failure message** names the file, its size and the ceiling, and says the remedy: §266
section 1 names the incentive a line ceiling creates ("a file at 2,050 lines can pass by deleting
50 lines of comments"), which would make the tree worse to buy a number. The remedy is to split
the file along a seam, and it is never to strip comments.
