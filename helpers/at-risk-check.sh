# Report lane worktrees holding uncommitted modifications that have sat too long: the one failure
# in this system that destroys rather than delays, because a prune of that worktree is a prune of
# whatever it was holding.
#
#     helpers/at-risk-check.sh          # one pass, then exit
#
# Three kinds of line, each work that GitHub cannot see and a prune can destroy:
#
#   UNCOMMITTED   a lane worktree with modifications older than `AT_RISK_MINUTES` (below).
#   DETACHED      a worktree on a detached HEAD. Nothing names it, so no branch listing finds it.
#   UNPUSHED      a local branch, in a worktree or not, holding commits no `origin/*` ref has.
#
# The last two were added by lane/orphan-work on 2026-10-06 (UTC), after a prune found two detached
# worktrees and five local branches with commits past their merged pull requests, none of them
# visible to the merge drain's `orphan` cause, which reads remote branches only. They are reported
# at once, with no clock: a prune is the moment they are lost. briefs/merge-and-cleanup.md runs this
# before anything is removed. Both read remote-tracking refs, so run `git fetch --prune origin`
# first; a stale `origin/*` ref for a deleted branch makes its commits look pushed.
#
# PROVISIONAL NAME. Minted 2026-09-23; not put to calef. See `Name:` below.
#
# # Why this exists
#
# AGENTS.md gives this exact check to the steward and calls it the more valuable of its two watches:
#
#   "It watches for work at risk, not only for idleness: a lane worktree with modifications and no
#   commit in half an hour is uncommitted work one prune away from gone, which is the only failure
#   in this system that destroys rather than delays. That check earns its keep more than the idle
#   one."
#
# It did not exist. `launchctl list` shows `com.nife.merge-drain` and `com.nife.trunk-health` and
# nothing else; the duty AGENTS.md assigns by name had no mechanism behind it, which is rung four of
# AGENTS.md's own ladder (a sentence, relying on someone remembering it) for the specific case the
# sentence says is worst to leave there.
#
# Measured cost, all in one session on 2026-09-23: a fix to `helpers/open-lane.sh` found only while
# pruning merged worktrees, a fix to `system_tests/src/user/live_swap_tests.rs` that survived two prunes
# uncommitted and had to be recovered twice, and 62 lines of a decisions amendment sitting unsaved
# on a branch for hours after the conversation moved on. The maintainer pruned worktrees twice that
# session; any of the three could have been destroyed rather than merely delayed.
#
# # What this deliberately does not do
#
# **It reports and never acts.** It does not commit, does not stash, does not touch a file outside
# its own read. Committing on somebody else's behalf would guess at a message and a scope that are
# not this script's to invent; the fix is a person reading this line and running `git add`/`git
# commit` themselves.
#
# **It does not use `git stash`.** The stash stack is per-`.git`, not per-worktree, so it is shared
# machine-wide across every worktree of this repository: one worktree's `git stash` can be popped by
# a session working in a different worktree entirely, which is exactly the kind of action-at-a-
# distance this script exists to protect people from, not commit. See notes/merge-queue.md and
# AGENTS.md's own note on the same hazard. Nothing here ever calls it.
#
# # The clock
#
# The risk clock is the newest modification time among the worktree's changed files (tracked and
# untracked), not the branch's last commit date. A worktree can carry a commit from hours ago and
# still be safe, mid-edit, seconds old; the fact that matters is how long the CURRENT uncommitted
# state has sat without being turned into a commit. `AT_RISK_MINUTES` (default 30, AGENTS.md's own
# "half an hour") is overridable the way `GRACE_MINUTES` already is in `helpers/lane-claim-check.sh`.
#
# # Name: unrecorded.
#
# Provisional, minted by this lane. "at-risk" is AGENTS.md's own phrase for exactly this ("work at
# risk"); "-check" matches `helpers/lane-claim-check.sh`, `script/qemu-check` and
# `script/stack-frame-check`. It lives in `helpers/` rather than `script/` for the same reason
# `merge-drain.sh` gives for itself: a maintainer's tool, not a front door a contributor types, so it
# carries no `notes/scripts.md` entry (`script/lint`'s "script docs" check only walks `script/`).
#
# # BUGS
#
#   - **It does not distinguish a lane mid-work from a lane that stalled.** Thirty minutes without a
#     commit is common for an actively-edited file too (a long edit, a long test run before
#     committing), so this can flag live work. It is not wrong to flag it: the risk (one prune away
#     from gone) is real in both cases, and the fix is the same (commit, or push what exists as a
#     patch). A reader still has to tell "safe, still typing" from "abandoned" the same way
#     `helpers/lane-claim-check.sh` leaves "safe to delete" versus "somebody has to look" to a
#     person.
#   - **It does not dedupe across passes.** Every call reports every worktree still over the
#     threshold, so a worktree that stays at risk for two hours is reported on every pass that reads
#     it, unlike `merge-drain.sh`'s `notify()` or `trunk-health.sh`'s own transition-only reporting.
#     That was a deliberate choice over adding a second piece of state to track "already said": a
#     worktree at risk stays exactly as at risk on the next pass, and repetition costs nothing more
#     than log lines, which is the same trade `helpers/lane-claim-check.sh` already makes for the
#     identical reason.
#   - **A worktree whose directory was removed without `git worktree remove` reports `prunable` and
#     is skipped rather than flagged.** There is nothing left in it to lose, so this is correct, not
#     a gap; noted because a reader diffing this script's count against `git worktree list`'s might
#     otherwise wonder where an entry went.
#   - **mtime, not content.** A file touched (e.g. by a formatter, or `touch`) without a real edit
#     ages this the same as a genuine change. `git diff --shortstat` in the report line at least says
#     how much moved, but nothing here reads whether the touch mattered.
