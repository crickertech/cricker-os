# Provisional name, calef has not ruled on it. Watch the CI runs that lanes are WAITING on
# (briefs/session-start.md, briefs/gate-in-ci.md): a lane ends its turn with one line,
# `WAITING <run_id> [<run_id>...] on <what>`, and this script is what turns that line into a wake-up
# instead of a lane nobody is watching for.
#
# Usage: the maintainer appends one line per run to runs.txt, "<run_id> <lane_agent_id> <label>",
# then starts (or leaves running, with run_in_background) `python3 helpers/runwatch.py [timeout]`.
# It polls every two minutes and exits (so the maintainer wakes) the moment a lane's runs are ALL
# finished, or ANY of them did not succeed; fired lines move to runs-done.txt with their conclusions
# and everything else stays in runs.txt so a relaunch keeps watching the rest. `timeout` (seconds,
# default 7200) bounds a heartbeat exit when nothing is ready yet, so a background poll does not run
# forever unattended.
#
# State lives under a directory this script does not itself pick a fixed answer for, on purpose:
# `helpers/` is checked into git and shared by every worktree, so a state file "beside the script"
# would be either untracked clutter in a tracked directory or, worse, shared and clobbered across
# concurrent lanes and sessions. NIFE_WATCH_DIR (an environment variable) names it; unset, it falls
# back to a directory under the system temp dir, which is stable per machine and never inside the
# repository, so this script works the same run from the repo root, a worktree, or a cron job.
