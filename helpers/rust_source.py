"""Reading this tree's Rust source, for the `script/` entry points that count things in it.

**Why this file exists.** Three derivations were written twice, once in a gate and once in the
dashboard, because each lived inside a `#!/bin/sh` script's inline `python3` heredoc: the `unsafe`
census (`script/lint` and `script/metrics`), the comment-and-literal strip the code-line and
comment-line split is built on (the same pair), and the proof-harness count (`script/falsifications`,
`script/metrics`, and a third derivation inside `script/lint`). A gate that changed its definition
would leave the dashboard quietly asserting the old one, with both looking authoritative and nothing
firing. See milestone 236 (three derivations are copied between scripts, and nothing notices when
they drift).

**The premise that made the copies look unavoidable is false, and checking it is what shrank this
milestone.** `script/lint` and `script/metrics` both `cd` to the repository root before they
`exec python3`, so their heredocs have a stable working directory, and a heredoc with a stable
working directory can `sys.path.insert(0, 'helpers')` and import like anything else. Nothing about
being a shell entry point prevented it. That matters because the alternative on the table was a host
crate, which would have made three `script/` commands depend on a `cargo build` and changed what a
`script/` command is; this changes nothing a caller can see.

**What is deliberately NOT here, and it is the part worth reading.** The file *sourcing* stays in
each caller, and only the derivation over text is shared. `script/lint` walks `git ls-files` and
reads the working tree, because a gate is asked about the tree in front of it. `script/metrics`
streams blobs out of `git cat-file --batch` at eight historical revisions and never checks anything
out, because a report is asked about the past and AGENTS.md forbids the checkout that would be
needed. That difference is exactly the tolerance milestone 236's block warned a shared
implementation might dissolve, so it is kept where it belongs: in the input, not in the count.

**And the harness count is still derived twice, on purpose.** `script/lint` and
`script/falsifications` attribute each harness to a workspace package from `cargo metadata`, which
needs a checked-out workspace and a cargo that can parse it. `script/metrics` cannot have either: it
reads blobs from July, nothing is on disk, and its own header records that nothing there is allowed
to build. `harness_count` below is the pure-text derivation the report uses; `script/lint` keeps its
own and **compares the two**, which is the honest answer for a question two callers genuinely cannot
ask the same way.

Every function here takes `files`, an iterable of `(path, text)` pairs, with `path` relative to the
repository root and slash-separated.

# is that something we should be monitoring and driving in a particular direction over time?" See
# notes/register-of-measures.md and notes/unsafe-obligations.md.
#
# Shapes assumed, each checked against the real tree rather than against expectation:
#   - a block is `unsafe` then optional whitespace then `{`, MINUS the `unsafe extern "C" {` form,
#     which is a linkage declaration and not a block anybody reasons about (zero in the tree today,
#     subtracted anyway so the day one lands it does not read as unsafe code);
#   - a thread-safety claim is an `unsafe impl` of Send or Sync SPECIFICALLY, which is a different
#     animal from an `unsafe impl` of an unsafe trait (`GlobalAlloc`, `intrusive_fifo::Node`): the
#     trait is unsafe there because its own contract is, while `unsafe impl Send for T` is a
#     hand-written assertion that the compiler is wrong about T, and it is the most consequential
#     unsafe in this tree. The `[^{;]*?` tail keeps it inside one item header so a body cannot
#     donate a match.
#
# There is deliberately NO `unsafe fn` count here. `script/lint`'s `==> unsafe fn contracts` check
# derives one and prints it, and a second count of the same thing taken from a slightly different
# scope is the drift milestone 134 exists to stop.

# What is out of the census, and every exclusion has a reason rather than a convenience.
#
# `bench/host/` holds the Linux and macOS programs the cross-OS comparison runs: ~100 `unsafe`
# blocks of libc FFI that those operating systems require and that say nothing about nife's
# soundness. Counting them would move the census every time somebody added a comparison. `xtask/`,
# `tools/`, `fuzz/` and `helpers/` are build and image tooling that runs on the developer's Mac and
# cannot fault the kernel.
#
# `patches/` is excluded for a different reason and it is the one worth reading: it holds our
# platform layer for Rust's `std`, which DOES run on the machine, so this is a real hole rather than
# a tidy boundary. It is out because a ceiling asserts a direction, and that code's shape is
# upstream's rather than ours: it implements `std`'s internal interfaces and cannot be restructured
# to hold fewer unsafe blocks without diverging further from the crate we are trying to track. It
# also matches the `unsafe fn contracts` check's scope, so there is one answer to "which Rust is
# ours" instead of two. The 37 blocks it leaves uncounted are recorded in
# notes/register-of-measures.md's BUGS, where a reader meets them.
#
# The list is exclusions rather than inclusions on purpose: a new subsystem directory is counted by
# default, and being left out has to be somebody's decision.

# --- the unsafe census, split by trust boundary (milestone: unsafe census by trust boundary,
# provisional) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `unsafe_census` above answers "how much unsafe code is there in the tree", and one population
# mixes two things that mean opposite things in a capability microkernel: an `unsafe` block inside
# `kernel/src` runs with no confinement over it at all, and an `unsafe` block in a userspace program
# is confined by the same MMU-plus-capability-table mechanism that confines every other program.
# `notes/trusted-base.md` (the `maintainer/redleaf-comparison` lane, 2026-09-20, landing alongside
# this one) hand-computed a first split -- kernel/src/** total 577, "everything else that runs on
# nife" 561 -- and flagged in its own BUGS that nothing keeps it computed. This is that mechanism.
#
# **The split that hand computation did NOT make, and the one this file exists to make**: crates/
# is not one population. `crates/paging` and `crates/direct_memory_access_validator` were lifted out
# of `kernel/src` on purpose so a model checker could reach them (see the BUGS in
# notes/trusted-base.md, which names exactly this risk: "a tree can shrink [the kernel line count]
# by moving code out of `kernel/src` without reducing what anyone has to trust"). A crate that ships
# ONLY in the kernel binary is the trusted base wherever it lives on disk; a crate that ships ONLY
# in a userspace program is confined wherever it lives; and roughly half of `crates/` ships in BOTH,
# which this split reports as a bucket of its own rather than guessing.
#
# **How the tables below were derived, 2026-09-20, on this worktree.** `cargo metadata
# --format-version 1`, once, at the repository root: every workspace member's `resolve.nodes[*].
# deps[*].dep_kinds` was read, and a crate is `KERNEL_ONLY`/`USERSPACE_ONLY` by whether it is
# reachable, over edges that are NOT exclusively `dev`, from the `kernel` package versus from
# `components` or `fixtures` (the two packages holding every EL0 program, milestone 175 (split
# `user/`: `components/` for services, `fixtures/` for test and benchmark programs)). A crate
# reachable from both sides is `SHARED`. This is mechanical and checkable
# (`cargo metadata | helpers/<this file's own derivation>`, not reproduced as a script here because
# `script/metrics` can never run cargo -- see this file's own module docstring -- so the result is
# baked in below, the same trade `MILESTONE_STATUSES`/`NAME_STATUSES` already make in
# `script/metrics`: today's definition, applied uniformly across history).
#
# **A `SHARED` crate is not a hedge.** `environment_protocol` and `clock_protocol` are the clearest
# cases: the kernel builds the shared page (`PageBuilder`) and a userspace `std` program reads it
# back through the identical `unsafe fn new`/`from_raw_parts` accessor, so the SAME unsafe source
# genuinely executes with kernel privilege in one binary and under confinement in another. There is
# no single number that is not either an overcount (attribute it to both) or an undercount
# (attribute it to neither), so it is reported as its own line rather than folded into either side.
#
# **What is not attempted here.** Some of a `SHARED` crate's unsafe may in fact be reached only from
# the kernel's own `#[cfg(test)]` modules (several of the Cargo.toml comments say exactly this: "the
# kernel does no date arithmetic of its own; its tests predict what the command printed"), which
# would mean it never ships in the production kernel binary at all. Telling that apart from unsafe
# the kernel's real logic calls needs a source-level, per-call-site read of each of the (currently
# five) `SHARED` crates that carry any `unsafe`, which this pass did not do; it is recorded as
# future work rather than guessed at.

# record, or it is not evidence), amended 2026-10-06): somebody looked for a defect in

# --- does a diff change compiled code, or only its comments ----------------------------------------
#
# The question `script/verify --affected-since` and `script/falsifications --affected-since` ask of
# each changed `.rs` file in a harness crate's closure, so that a comment edit (a spelling sweep, a
# path rewritten inside a comment) does not replay every proof. Found 2026-10-06 (UTC) on #1734,
# which rewrote `proposals/<slug>.md` paths inside comments across many crates: its re-falsify leg
# reached every record and was cancelled at the 45-minute limit.
#
# **A lexer and not `strip_non_code` above**, because the two answer opposite questions. That one
# blanks string literals along with comments, which is right for counting code lines and wrong
# here: an edit to a string literal changes the compiled program and must count. Nor a regex over
# lines, which reads the `//` in `"http://..."` as a comment. `rustc -Z unpretty` was the other
# candidate and lost because it parses rather than lexes: it wants the crate's modules on disk at
# one revision, and here the base revision is a blob that is not checked out.
#
# The rule. Two texts are the same program when their token sequences are equal with comments
# removed. Whitespace and comments are both separators to rustc, so a comment is replaced by "a
# separation happened" and nothing else. Spacing is kept only where rustc keeps it, between two
# adjacent punctuation characters (`>>` against `> >`, rustc's `Spacing::Joint`); between two words
# a separation already makes two tokens, and next to a word it carries no meaning.
#
# **Doc comments (`///`, `//!`, `/** */`, `/*! */`) are removed too, by default, and that is a
# claim with two parts.** First, a doc comment can hold a doctest, and a doctest is not a Kani
# harness and not a falsification record: `cargo kani` never runs one, so editing it cannot change
# a proof's verdict. Second, a doc comment is a `#[doc = "..."]` attribute, which is metadata unless
# a macro reads it and makes it code (`clap`'s derive turns it into help text, `displaydoc` into a
# `Display` impl). The caller passes `docs_are_code=True` when the dependency graph holds a
# procedural macro outside `DOC_BLIND_PROC_MACROS`, so a new one arriving makes doc comments count
# until somebody reads it and adds it to the list. A `macro_rules!` that captures `$(#[$m:meta])*`
# and stringifies it can do the same, and nothing checks for that (BUGS in script/falsifications).

# The procedural macros in this tree's dependency graph that never read a `#[doc]` attribute into
# code, read from each crate's derive or attribute (2026-10-06, UTC): `serde_derive` reads
# `#[serde]`, `thiserror-impl` reads `#[error]`, `defmt-macros` reads its format strings, and
# `rustversion` reads the compiler version.
