# helpers/hold-rerun.sh: once a hold is released, rerun every failed or cancelled
# `architect-hold.yml` run on a pull request's current head, so the newest result is the one
# GitHub counts.
#
#     helpers/hold-rerun.sh <pr-number> <owner/repo>
#
# Exit 0: done (reran something, or nothing needed it). 1: a hold label is still on, so nothing was
# rerun. 2: the API could not be read. Caller: architect-ruled-clears-hold.yml, on `architect-ruled`
# added or `needs-architect` / `held-by-lane` removed.
#
# Why: each label event starts a new hold run, and the release event's run passes, but GitHub kept
# counting the older red run against the head. #1766, 2026-10-06: run 37498758799 failed at
# 16:49:41Z on `needs-architect`; the hold was released and later runs on the same SHA passed, yet
# the armed pull request stayed out of the queue until a maintainer reran that run by hand at
# 19:02:09Z (attempt 2). A rerun re-reads the live labels, so it turns green only if the release is
# real.
#
# "Released" is architect-hold.yml's own test, copied because that required check runs with no
# checkout: `held-by-lane` holds; else `architect-ruled` releases; else `needs-architect` holds;
# else released. Change one and you must change the other; hold-rerun-selftest.sh pins this copy.
#
# Hold runs still in flight are waited for first (bounded, HOLD_RERUN_WAIT tries of
# HOLD_RERUN_SLEEP seconds), because a run started by the label that was just removed can still
# be running and would land red after this pass. The labels are read after that wait.
#
# Same-second duplicates (notes/merge-queue.md BUGS, #1203): the drain reruns a cancelled
# duplicate once. This rerun can race it on the same run id; the loser's `gh run rerun` errors
# and is logged, not fatal. Selftest: helpers/hold-rerun-selftest.sh. Name: provisional, 2026-10-06.
