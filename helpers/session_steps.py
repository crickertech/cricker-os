"""Which of one day's `calef`-account steps on GitHub an agent session can claim.

**Why this exists.** calef's `gh` token is used by calef and by every agent session on patagonia,
so GitHub credits both to `calef` and records no difference (measured 2026-10-03 UTC: the
`performed_via_github_app` field is null on every `calef` event and comment, because `gh` is an
OAuth App and not a GitHub App). The 2026-10-03 correction of error (the queue judged one pull
request at a time) could not say which dequeues were calef's own for that reason. Milestone 642
(the record should say whether a person or the machinery took a step) is the fix going forward,
and a new identity cannot attribute anything retroactively. Session transcripts can: each Claude
Code session writes every Bash call it made, with a timestamp, under `~/.claude/projects/`.

**What it does.** It lists the day's deliberate `calef`-actor issue events (dequeues, arming,
ready, labels, drafts, renames) on the repository, finds every transcript Bash call that ran a
mutating `gh` command naming the same pull request, and reports each event as claimed by the
session whose call came at most `--window` seconds before it, or as `unmatched`.

**What a result means, which is less than it looks.** A match is evidence and not proof: a session
that touched #N for another reason inside the window claims an event it did not cause. An
`unmatched` event is the weaker half again: it is calef by hand, OR a session whose transcript is
gone, on another machine, or not Claude Code. This is the positive half only, which is why
milestone 642's block refuses a local log as the answer and keeps it as a complement.

Name provisional (milestone 642's lane); `design/naming.md` is the rule.

EXAMPLES

    python3 helpers/session_steps.py --date 2026-10-03
    python3 helpers/session_steps.py --date 2026-10-03 --kinds removed_from_merge_queue
    python3 helpers/session_steps.py --selftest

On 2026-10-03 the first reported 229 of 250 deliberate `calef` steps claimed by a session. The 10
unmatched dequeues include all four calef recalls making by hand that day (#1530 once, #1534,
#1547, #1557). It also claims three #1530 dequeues for the session where that day's record has
two, which is the coincidence limit below showing itself on real data.

BUGS

- A session that ran any mutating `gh` command on #N inside the window claims every `calef` event
  on #N in it, including one calef took by hand at the same moment.
- Only Claude Code transcripts are read. A session run under opencode (the z.ai week) claims
  nothing, and its steps read as `unmatched`.
- Transcripts age out (Claude Code's `cleanupPeriodDays`, 30 days by default, recalled rather
  than measured), and they exist only on the machine that ran the session.
- Pull request numbers are found by pattern in the command text. A command that computes the
  number at run time (`xargs`, a shell variable) names no number and claims nothing.
- The repository-wide issue events endpoint pages back about 90 days, and further only per issue.
