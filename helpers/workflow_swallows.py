"""A workflow step that swallows its own failure says where the failure goes instead.

    helpers/workflow_swallows.py              # script/lint: fail on an unlabelled swallow
    helpers/workflow_swallows.py --selftest   # fixtures, no tree; script/lint runs it first

Milestone 641 (a mechanism that reports clean says over how many units, and zero is loud),
provisional number. The file name and the label vocabulary below are provisional too; naming is an
architect's. A python module under `helpers/`, outside `script/names`' scope, so its provenance is
this paragraph. The reasoning and the per-site labels are in notes/denominators.md.

# WHY

From outside, a check that examined nothing looks exactly like a check that found nothing. The
weekly falsification sweep replayed zero patches on three Mondays and reported success each time
(notes/corrections/2026-09-23-the-sweep-that-swept-nothing.md), because `continue-on-error: true`
discarded the exit status of a script that had refused to run. A step's exit status is one channel
carrying two claims: the VERDICT ("it ran and found something for a human") and the OUTCOME ("it did
not run"). Suppressing a verdict can be right. Suppressing an outcome never is, unless somebody
decided so and wrote down why.

A script under `script/` can make its own zero loud: milestone 401 (a gate that selects the set it
judges can pass by checking nothing) did that half, and a script that exits non-zero on an empty
population needs no workflow cooperation. A workflow can hide that zero
again in exactly two ways, and this checks both:

1. **`continue-on-error` with anything but `false`.** Each one carries a trailing label on the same
   line, `# outcome: <kind>`, and the kind is checked against the job:
   - `re-raised`: the step has an `id:`, and a LATER step in the same job has an `if:` testing
     `steps.<id>.outcome == 'failure'` or `!= 'success'`. That later step is where the job goes red.
   - `reported`: the step has an `id:`, and a later step in the same job reads
     `${{ steps.<id>.outcome }}` as a value, so the failure travels into whatever that step writes
     (a pull request body, a summary).
   - `exception, <reason>`: the outcome is swallowed on purpose. The reason is required and is all a
     machine can ask for; whether it is a good reason is a reviewer's.
   `steps.<id>.conclusion` never counts. With `continue-on-error` the conclusion of a failed step is
   `success`, so a test on it can never fire; it is the one spelling that looks right and is not.
2. **A pipeline into `tee` without pipefail.** GitHub's default `run` shell is `bash -e {0}`, which
   gives a pipeline `tee`'s status, and `tee` succeeds. A step that pipes a command into `tee` must
   say `shell: bash` (GitHub then adds `-o pipefail`) or `set -o pipefail` itself. A pipeline headed
   by `echo` or `printf` is exempt: it has no outcome to lose.

# WHAT IT CANNOT SEE (recorded where a reader meets it)

- `|| true`, `2>/dev/null`, `if: always()` and a selector inside a `run:` block that can select
  nothing. notes/denominators.md labels the first three by family; most `|| true` sites feed an
  empty string into a test that fails toward doing more, which is the safe direction, and no parse
  can tell that from the other kind.
- A job-level `defaults: run: shell:` is not read; a step in such a job that pipes into `tee` names
  its shell itself or is flagged.
- A step in a composite action under `.github/actions/` is not walked. None exists today.
- `re-raised` checks that the later step tests the outcome, not that its body exits non-zero.

Plain text parse, no YAML library: the runner image and the developer machine do not agree on one.
