"""Package boundaries: every tracked path has a home, and every crate and program has a package.

Milestone 611 (every program and crate belongs to a package, and every package has a home). calef
ruled on 2026-09-27, on pull request #1389 (its decision's fork 3), that the tree stays one repository for
now "with package boundaries drawn and enforced inside it by lint check", and that the end state is
everything moving out, with no default of staying. This file is that lint check, and the count the
weekly metrics page draws from it.

    python3 helpers/packages.py --check      # what script/lint runs
    python3 helpers/packages.py --selftest   # planted violations, no tree, no git
    python3 helpers/packages.py --table        # the table notes/package-boundaries.md carries
    python3 helpers/packages.py --write-table  # write it there, between the markers
    python3 helpers/packages.py --summary    # one line of counts

Name: provisional, minted by milestone 611's lane on 2026-09-27. So are the key names below, every
package name and every home. calef names things and rules formats; the note
notes/package-boundaries.md lists the questions.

**A package's kind says where it ends up** (calef ratified the rule and the four kinds at
2026-09-27T07:23Z, UTC). `base`: every image. `optional`: a running nife that installs it. `sdk`: a
developer's machine (the contracts, the runtime, the host tools). `test`: a test image, never a
release. Not what a package does, and not who runs it.

**Two declarations, because calef separated them (2026-09-27): "Everything in the tree may not be
in a package, but it may be in a repo."**

TOML, both of them (calef, 2026-09-27: package declarations and recipes move to TOML; JSON was
refused for having no comments, and YAML too). The extensions and every key name are provisional.
An unknown key is refused, so a misspelt one cannot read as an absent one.

1. `packages/<name>.package.toml`, one per package: what releases, updates and is trusted together.

       name = "process-tools"       required; equals the file's stem
       kind = "base"                required, no default: base, optional, sdk or test
       home = { repo = "process-tools", status = "provisional" }
                                    required, no default; or { repo, status = "ratified", date },
                                    or { status = "undecided", reason = "..." }
       crates = ["ps"]              member crates; each claims its directory
       interfaces = ["abi"]         member crates other packages may link without declaring them
       programs = ["ps"]            member programs; each claims its source file
       paths = ["patches/"]         member paths (the std overlay, a recipe, a `#[path]` module)
       depends = ["init"]           declared dependencies; their crates may be linked
       subtree_grants = "subtree_scope"
                                    this package's file server enforces subtree grants itself,
                                    through the scope crate named (milestone 606 (a directory
                                    walk costs what it does on Linux), ruling T1; provisional)
       [[exception]]                one recorded, dated link across a boundary the rules refuse:
       date = 2026-09-27            date, member, crate and reason, all required
       member = "kernel"
       crate = "ps"
       reason = "..."

2. `packages/homes.toml`, for tracked paths in no package: project records, CI, scripts, bench
   data. One `[[home]]` table per home, its keys those of `home` above plus `paths`.

**The rules, each a rule over the tree and none a list of names:**

- Every tracked path has exactly one home. A path's claim is the longest prefix naming it, among
  every package member and every `packages/homes.toml` entry; two claims of the same prefix fail, and so
  does a path nothing claims. A package's paths take the package's home.
- Every Cargo package in the tree is a member of exactly one package, and so is every binary target.
  A crate's binaries go with it, unless any of them is placed in another package: then every one
  of its binaries needs a `program` line (`components` today), so a new program in a crate that
  hosts several packages is placed on purpose and never by default.
- A link across a package boundary is allowed to an `interface` crate, to any crate of a package
  the linker `depends` on, or under a dated `exception`. Anything else is reaching into another
  package's internals. Normal and build dependencies are checked; dev-dependencies are not, because
  they never ship (the note's BUGS says what that leaves open).
- A crate whose binaries sit in several packages is checked per program instead, by the crate names
  each program's source mentions, since its manifest's dependency list is the union of all of them.
- Nothing but a `test` package depends on a `test` package, and a `base` package does not depend on
  an `optional` one.
- An exception whose link no longer exists fails, so the list can only shrink by being fixed.

Dependencies come from each `Cargo.toml` read with `tomllib`, not from `cargo metadata`, so the
same code runs over a historical commit for `script/metrics` without a checkout or a network.
