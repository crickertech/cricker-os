# The merge drain, after 2026-10-03: it watches the queue and says who must act. It never arms,
# enqueues or re-queues a pull request.
#
#     helpers/merge-drain.sh              # one pass
#     helpers/merge-drain.sh --dry-run    # one pass, printing every write instead of making it
#
# PROVISIONAL NAME. Minted 2026-08-04 for a script that drained the queue by arming it, and kept
# when that stopped, because a rename is calef's call. See notes/merge-queue.md.
#
# # What it does
#
#   - Labels `needs-maintainer` (name provisional) on a pull request a maintainer session must pick
#     up, comments once per cause with the evidence, and takes the label off when the cause is
#     gone (`needs_maintainer`, below; the decision is helpers/needs-maintainer.jq).
#   - Dequeues a pull request that picked up `needs-architect`, `held-by-lane` or
#     `held-for-red-trunk` after it was enqueued (`dequeue_held`).
#   - Labels a paused draft `unblocked` once its `Blocked-by:` pull requests have resolved.
#   - Reruns, once, a CI run a concurrency group cancelled as a same-second duplicate.
#   - Opens a draft for a branch holding work that never had a pull request, so the label has
#     somewhere to go (the `orphan` cause's `adopt`; it never touches the branch).
#   - Reruns, once, the workflow owning a required check that never reported on an armed head whose
#     runs have all finished, and flags `missing-check` when that did not help (`missing_check_scan`).
#   - Runs helpers/lane-claim-check.sh, which reports a pushed lane branch with no pull request.
#
# # What it stopped doing, and why (milestone 727 (a queue eviction goes to a maintainer session), provisional; calef's rulings on #1564)
#
# On 2026-10-03 calef was the queue's only working detector: he spotted each conflicting or
# failing pull request, took it out, and told the maintainer session. Meanwhile this script armed
# every eligible pull request on every pass, re-armed ejected ones, enqueued what auto-merge had
# left behind, and commented on stalls. It re-queued pull requests the calef account had just
# taken out six or seven times that day, gave the already-merged #1555 a stale queue entry, and its
# 478 stall comments since 2026-08-26 moved nobody (55% of pull requests saw an action in the hour
# after one, 50% in the hour before). The record is
# notes/coes/2026-10-03-the-queue-judged-one-pull-request-at-a-time.md.
#
# calef ruled: "I don't want the job of watching the queue." So the arming, the re-arming, the
# enqueue of a stranded pull request, the stall comments, the stale-draft and stuck-check reports
# and milestone 630 (a merge-queue ejection is caught before the queue, and recovered after it)'s ejection hold all went. A lane arms its own pull request in the same command
# as `gh pr ready`. What none of them did was hand a problem to someone whose job it is, and that
# is the one thing built in their place.
#
# # Where it runs
#
# `.github/workflows/merge-drain.yml`, as `nife-smelter[bot]`, every five minutes and whenever CI
# completes. A pass from a checkout is the same pass, as whatever `gh` is logged in as. The old
# watching form is gone: the schedule is the loop, and a loop on a laptop was a second actor.

# **Dequeue anything now held that is already in the merge queue.** Admission is checked once, at

#
# **This is not hypothetical and the window is small enough to lose a race in.** On 2026-09-18 this
# drain enqueued #923 at 03:53:36; its lane, which had discovered mid-flight that its work disproved

# three seconds. calef noticed it merging and it was dequeued by hand. The lane had already dequeued
# itself once at 03:08:05, and this drain simply put it back, which is the part a lane cannot defend
# against on its own.
#
# The shape is AGENTS.md's ladder: the label was rung two (a gate that fires without being
# remembered) for everything *except* the queue, where it was rung zero. This closes that, on the

#
# Draft #1289 was paused on 2026-09-25 waiting on #1288. #1288 merged an hour later. Nobody resumed
# #1289 for two days, because the pause was recorded only in prose (a comment, a report). A mechanism that fires once and a fact that lives only in prose is exactly the shape
# AGENTS.md's ladder warns about: "somebody will notice" is rung zero.
#
# So this is rung two instead: a draft that names `Blocked-by: #N[, #M ...]` in its own body gets a
# label, `unblocked`, and one comment, the moment every listed pull request has merged or been
# reported closed. Both are visible without opening the pull request: `gh pr list --label unblocked`
# is the whole board, the same shape as `gh pr list --draft` and `gh pr list --label
# needs-architect` already are.
#
# The decision itself (merged, still open, closed unmerged, or already labelled) is
# helpers/blocked-by-resolution.jq, spliced in below the same way helpers/queue-eligible.jq is

#
# BUGS, the `orphan` cause's (lane/orphan-work, 2026-10-06 UTC):
#   - Its clock is the branch tip's committer date, not the branch's birth, so a lane that keeps
#     pushing without a pull request is never called an orphan while it pushes. The birth clock
#     `helpers/lane-claim-check.sh` reads is the repository activity feed, one page deep; a tip
#     clock needs no second call and fires two hours after a lane stops, which is the case that
#     went unseen.
#   - It reads the first 100 branches. The repository had 23 on 2026-10-06; past 100, a branch
#     beyond the page is not seen.
#   - It cannot see work that never left a laptop: a detached HEAD or an unpushed commit is
#     invisible to GitHub. helpers/at-risk-check.sh lists those, and briefs/merge-and-cleanup.md
#     runs it before a prune.
#   - helpers/lane-claim-check.sh still prints the same branches to this log, on its own clocks.
#     Folding it into this cause, or keeping it, is calef's call (#1787).
#
# BUGS, the `unmergeable` cause's (lane/queue-unmergeable-report, 2026-10-07 UTC):
#   - No grace period. Whether GitHub ever shows `UNMERGEABLE` for a moment and then clears it on
#     its own is unmeasured; if it does, this labels and comments on noise, and the label comes off
#     a pass later. If the log shows the label going on and coming off one pass apart, key a grace
#     on `enqueuedAt` the way `unarmed` uses `$minutes`.
#   - The comment compares the head with each entry ahead one pair at a time. An entry can be
#     unmergeable only against two of them together, or for a reason that is not a textual
#     conflict; then every line reads "merges cleanly", and the verdict rests on GitHub's word.
#   - The dedupe key is the head. A head dequeued and enqueued again that goes `UNMERGEABLE` a
#     second time is labeled again but not commented again; the first comment still applies.
#   - It reads the first 100 entries, and it sees the queue only when a pass runs: every five
#     minutes when GitHub's scheduler keeps up, and whenever a CI run completes, which includes the
#     merge-group runs of the entries ahead (merge-drain.yml's BUGS has why the schedule is a floor).
