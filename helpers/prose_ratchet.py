"""The prose ratchet: §212's word cap and §213's density rules, held to a baseline that only falls.

Milestone 586 (a prose ratchet in lint). calef ratified both decisions on 2026-09-23 with a ratchet
as their enforcement and no gate built, and the budget slipped twice on 2026-09-24 because nothing
checked it: a lane moved facts into notes already over the cap and each note grew. This is the gate.

    python3 helpers/prose_ratchet.py --check          # what script/lint runs
    python3 helpers/prose_ratchet.py --report PATH..  # one document's measures, and why
    python3 helpers/prose_ratchet.py --bank           # lower the baseline to the tree; never raises
    python3 helpers/prose_ratchet.py --init           # write the baseline from scratch (milestone 586 only)
    python3 helpers/prose_ratchet.py --remeasure      # once, in the change that bumps MEASURE (see there)

Name: provisional, minted by milestone 586's lane on 2026-09-24. A shared python module under
`helpers/`, which `script/names` puts out of its own scope, so its provenance is this paragraph
rather than a `Name:` block. calef names things; expect this to change. Refused `prose_budget`,
which is §212's half alone and the name `script/metrics` already gives its graph column.

**What it measures, per document.** Four things, each against a ratified limit:

| measure | limit | decision |
|---|---|---|
| words of main body | 3,000 | §212 (a prose budget) |
| median sentence, in words | 20 | §213 (writing standards) rule 1 |
| longest sentence, in words | 40 | §213 rule 2 |
| bold spans per 1,000 words | 4 | §213 rule 3, held as two counts: line-opening and inline |

**The ratchet.** A measure at or under its limit passes. A measure over it passes only if the
committed baseline (`design/prose-baseline.tsv`) records the document as already over on that
measure and the document has not got worse than the baseline says. A document missing from the
baseline, which is every new one, meets the limits outright. Against the merge base as well: a
document that shrank on `main` without anyone banking the shrink may not grow back into the slack,
because §212's rule is "may not grow", not "may not exceed a number written down once".

**Exceptions** are HTML comments in the document, where a reader meets them, and they need a date
and a `Reason:` so that an exception says out loud that it is one (AGENTS.md's ladder):

    <!-- prose-budget: exception. ... Ratified by calef on 2026-09-24 ... Reason: ... -->
    <!-- writing-standards: exception. ... on 2026-09-24 ... Reason: ... -->

`prose-budget` is the syntax `AGENTS.md` and `design/fatal-risks/README.md` already carried, provisionally,
when this was built, and it is honoured as written. `writing-standards` is its §213 twin and is
provisional. An exception exempts its decision's measures entirely, which is what both decisions
say it does ("passes only if it did not get worse, or carries a marked exception").

**The orphan check.** An appendix is a file under `X/` beside a document `X.md` (§212's default
siting), and it must be linked from `X.md` or from `X/README.md`. `X/README.md` itself is the
directory's provenance page, not an appendix, and is exempt. A thematic appendix directory
(§212's permitted exception, `design/tenets/` today) is named in `THEMATIC_APPENDIX_DIRS` below and
its files must be linked from its own `README.md`. An appendix nothing links to is a lost document.

**What is counted, exactly**, because §213 records a first measurement that was wrong by ten words
of median and a gate built on it would fail documents that pass:

- Fenced code, HTML comments and YAML frontmatter are not prose and are stripped before anything.
- Words are whitespace-separated tokens of what remains, tables included (a table is read).
- Sentences are split on block boundaries first (blank lines, headings, list-item starts, table
  rows, blockquotes), and only then within a block, on `.`, `!` or `?` followed by whitespace and
  anything that can open a sentence, unless the word before the stop is an abbreviation. §213's
  splitter asked for a capital; this tree starts sentences with `calef` and `xenon`, so that one
  ran them together. Headings and table rows are not sentences (§213's own method stripped
  tables). These choices put the corpus lower than §213 measured: 17 words for the median
  document's median sentence, against 20.
- Quoted text is exempt from both sentence limits (586's design note of 2026-09-24): a verbatim
  quote cannot be rewrapped without changing what the speaker said. So a blockquote is skipped and
  a `"..."` span is removed from its sentence before the sentence is measured; the lead-in around
  it is still prose and still counts.
- Inline code is one word in a sentence, since it is verbatim, and all its words in the word count.
  A link counts as its text.
- Bold is `**...**` outside code and outside table rows (§213's table-cell precedent). It opens a
  line when nothing but indentation, a list marker or a blockquote marker precedes it. Bold inside
  a quote still counts: bold is the writer's markup, not the speaker's. Bold a script parses
  (`**Status:`, `**Built:**`, a Follow-on tag) is syntax and is not counted; see `derived_markers`.
- The median and the bold density are only asked of documents of at least 200 words, the floor
  §213's own per-document statistics used. A median of five sentences or a density over 90 words is
  a coin toss, and a new three-line README with one bold word would otherwise fail at 11 per 1,000.
  The longest-sentence limit applies to every document.

**Bold is judged on density in any document a change touches** (calef, 2026-09-26 UTC: "4 bolds
per 1000 is the right ratio for our written prose. That it was previously written without density
is irrelevant. Bold should be rare."). A document whose content differs from the merge base must
be at or under 4 bold per 1,000 words afterwards, and its baseline bold columns grant it nothing.
This was built first as two counts, because density is bold over words and a lane that condenses a
document raises it. The answer now is that whoever condenses a document removes its bold too.

Untouched documents passed on their baseline bold counts, so the tree did not go red on the day
of the ruling. That allowance is spent: the backlog reached zero on 2026-10-06 (UTC), the baseline's
bold columns are empty, and `check` refuses any bold ceiling there, so every document meets the
limit whether or not a change touches it. "Touched" is the diff against the merge base this module already takes for its
tight half, read with renames: a pure rename (100% similar) is not a touch, and an edit is.

**A mechanical rename is not a touch either** (calef, 2026-09-27T05:23Z, ruling on the
architect-role-census sweep, PR #1289: "a mechanical rename that adds no new sentence does not
count as touching a document for the §212/§213 prose ratchet"). That sweep's own substitution
adds a word almost everywhere it lands ("calef's" to "an architect's"), which both the word-count
ceiling and the bold-density touch rule read as growth though nobody wrote a new sentence.
`RENAME_PAIRS` names the forms this sweep produces, each mapped back to the form it replaced, and
`rename_masked` reads a line through that mapping before a document is measured or diffed: a line
whose only difference from its old version is one of these substitutions is read as unchanged; a
line that also carries a new sentence still differs after the mapping, and still counts. This is
the general mechanism the class exception asked for, so a future rename of this shape needs a new
pair in the list, not a new per-file exception.

# names an installed program to the spawner) found it: `**Status: …`, `**Built:**`, `**Gate: …**`,
# the Follow-on and Revisit tags and fatal-risks' experiment lead-ins are read by scripts, and in a short block that bold alone is over 4 per 1,000 words, so the touch
# rule would have made those documents uneditable. Parsed bold is not counted at all.
#
# The set is DERIVED from the parsers, not listed here: every `re.compile`/`re.match`/`re.search`/
# `re.finditer`/`re.findall` whose pattern is a literal containing `\*\*`, and every
# `.startswith("**X…")`, in the Python of `script/*` (the heredoc a shell wrapper runs) and
# `helpers/*.py`. A parser that adds a marker is honoured the day it lands, with nothing to update.
# A single shared module was considered and not built: the parsers disagree about their own
# markers (five spellings of the Status line across six scripts), so sharing one definition means
# either changing what eight gates accept, which is its own decision, or re-homing each variant
# verbatim, which shares nothing. Deriving reads each variant where it lives.
#
# The failure mode of deriving is a generic pattern (one that matches any bold) exempting everything.
