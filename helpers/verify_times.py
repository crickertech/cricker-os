Name: provisional, minted 2026-10-07 (UTC) by lane/verify-shard-refresh. A python helper under
`helpers/`, outside `script/names`' scope, so this paragraph is its provenance. Refused
`shard_balance`, which names one of its four jobs.

# WHY

Milestone 119 (the merge queue is the bottleneck, and the long pole is one prover) packs the `prove`
shards by a seconds-per-crate table in script/verify. Those seconds were read once, on 2026-08-14,
from one arm64 CI log, and five rows after that were dev-Mac numbers. By 2026-10-06 the shards had
moved to x86_64 (milestone 587 (most CI jobs do not need an arm64 host)) and `machine_discovery` had
grown from 180 seconds to 689, so the table planned 19.8 minutes for a shard that took 27, and
nothing said so: a stale row costs balance, never correctness, and so it failed in silence. calef approved a
refresh on 2026-10-07 and asked for a chart.

This file is the mechanism that keeps the table honest without anyone remembering to:

- `shard` is the packer itself, moved out of script/verify so that the run, the refresh and the
  check below all plan shards with one function rather than three that can disagree.
- `shard-check` runs at the end of every CI shard and compares what the shard took against what the
  table planned. **It warns and never fails** (see SHARD_WARN_PCT).
- `refresh` is what `.github/workflows/verify-shard-refresh.yml` runs weekly: medians from the
  last REFRESH_RUNS green runs, and a rewrite of the table's seconds when they drifted.
- `update` writes `notes/project-metrics/verify-runs.csv`, one row per sampled run, which
  `script/metrics` reads into the weekly "how long verify takes" chart.

# WHERE THE SECONDS COME FROM

From job logs. script/verify prints `==> kani-seconds: <crate> <n>` after each crate (since
2026-10-07). A log older than that line is read from the GitHub timestamps on its `==> kani:`
lines instead, which is how the 2026-08-14 table was made and is accurate to the second: a crate's
time runs from its own `==> kani:` line to the next one, and the last crate's to its final
`Complete - ` line. Both measure wall clock at VERIFY_JOBS=2, compile included, which is the
quantity the packer needs (crates run one after another; harnesses inside one run two at a time).

# BUGS

- `update` samples at most PER_DAY runs a day rather than every run, to keep a daily fetch near a
  hundred API calls. The weekly figures are medians over the sample, not over every run.
- A run counts only if every `prove` shard in it succeeded. A shard killed by the memory limit or
  by a failing proof says nothing about how long a passing one takes, and would drag a median.
- Runner speed is not controlled. The same crate on the same commit varied by 30% across the 40
  runs of 2026-10-06 (glob: 455 to 801 seconds), which is why every decision here uses medians and
  thresholds well above that spread.
