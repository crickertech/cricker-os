"""Is this diff prose that no build and no test reads? If so CI skips the heavy jobs.

    helpers/prose_only.py classify <base>   # the CI gate: <base>..HEAD, one line per changed file
    helpers/prose_only.py --selftest        # script/lint: fixtures, no git

Host-only tools (lane/ci-scope-host-scripts, 2026-10-07 UTC): the output is still called `prose`
and the skip still means "no build or test reads this", because renaming the output touches every
heavy job's `if:`. A second class rides it, see HOST_ONLY_TOOLS below.

Name: provisional, minted by lane/docs-only-ci on 2026-10-05 UTC. A helper under `helpers/`,
outside `script/names`' scope, so its provenance is this paragraph. Refused `docs_only`, because
"docs" also covers a crate's README and rustdoc, which are code here, and this decides prose only.

# WHY

Every pull request ran the whole suite, Markdown or not. On 2026-10-05 twelve pull requests that
only removed `**` markers from design/ and notes/ took the hosted runner pool, and required jobs on
#1708 and #1712 were cancelled with "The job was not acquired by Runner of type hosted even after
multiple attempts". Before this file each heavy job decided "documentation only" for itself, nine
copies of one regex inside steps, so every one of them still took a runner to find out it had
nothing to do. The gate now decides once, and a prose-only change skips those jobs outright.

# THE RULE

A changed file is **prose** when it ends in `.md` and lies under `notes/`, `design/` or `briefs/`,
or at the repository root, AND nothing in the tree at the head being tested reads it. A diff is
prose-only when it is non-empty and every file in it is prose. Anything else runs everything.

"Nothing reads it" is computed from the tree on every run, never from a list. A list of consumers
somebody has to remember to extend is rung three at best and would rot the first time a lane added
an `include_str!` (calef, 2026-10-05). Every tracked file that could read something is scanned:
everything except Markdown, the prose directories themselves (their `.csv`, `.svg` and `.patch`
files are records), captured data (`.log`, `.csv`, `.tsv`) and `vendor/`. Comment lines are dropped
(`//`, `/*` or `*` anywhere, `#` outside Rust, where it opens an attribute; a `.patch` contributes
the lines it leaves in the tree). Two shapes count:

- **A file reference**: a `*.md` token used as a path. It is resolved repository-relative, relative
  to the referring file, with leading `../` stripped, and from any `notes/`, `design/` or `briefs/`
  inside it (`$root/notes/x.md`), and a changed file matching any of these is an input. This is
  what catches `include_str!`, `#[doc = include_str!(...)]`, a build script's read, xtask's
  `DOC_BUNDLES` (the notes the disk image installs and swish-check searches with `apropos`), a
  Cargo.toml `readme`, and a workflow that cats a note. A token inside a quoted string that holds
  whitespace is a sentence (`"see notes/stack.md"`) and is not counted: a message reads nothing.
  Anything the check cannot place, such as the middle line of a long Rust string, is counted, so
  it errs toward a full run.
- **A directory reference**: a quoted string that is exactly a prose directory (`"notes"`,
  `"design/roadmap"`) or a glob under one (`"design/roadmap/*.md"`). Code that names a directory
  walks it, so everything beneath it is read by the package that holds the code. In a `.rs` file
  the package is the nearest Cargo.toml's, and a prose-only run tests it (`prose_tests`): today that
  is `crates/documentation`'s corpus test, which went red on main on 2026-09-23 while the old
  predicate skipped it, and xtask. A package that cannot test on the host fails that step loudly.
  Rust in no package runs everything.

Why not the compiler's own record (cargo's dep-info, `target/**/*.d`)? It would be exact for
`include_str!`, but it exists only after a build, and the gate's purpose is to decide before any
build takes a runner. CI uploads no dep-info a gate could read. And dep-info cannot see a runtime
read, which is the larger half (DOC_BUNDLES, the corpus walk). The grep of the head tree is the
honest fallback: it errs toward running and it sees a new reference in the same diff that adds it.

The decision for every changed file is printed with the rule that made it, so a wrong skip can be
diagnosed from the gate's log.

# HOST-ONLY TOOLS

#1831 changed `notes/project-metrics.md` and `script/metrics` (a Python report generator) and ran
the whole kernel suite, because `script/metrics` is not Markdown. Nothing a gated job runs reads
it: the only caller is `.github/workflows/metrics.yml` (weekly, not a pull request job), and
`script/lint` runs the selftests of the helpers beside it. So a file named in HOST_ONLY_TOOLS counts as skippable
when no tree file outside `script/`, `helpers/` and `.github/workflows/metrics.yml` names it on a
non-comment line (by its path, or for a Python helper by its module name). Unlike the prose
rule this is a short list somebody had to verify, because `script/` and `helpers/` files name each
other in docstrings everywhere and a derived closure over them was measured on 2026-10-07 to
call all but a few of 159 files reachable; the check above is the fail-safe half, and the list is
the exception, written down as one. Unlisted paths (every other `script/` and `helpers/` file, the
workflow itself) run everything. The tools and metrics.yml also stop counting as readers of
prose, which is what lets #1831's note edit skip (the page names itself in both). `script/metrics --selftest` has no gate of its own, so the
`lint` job, which never skips, runs it.

# HOST-ONLY OUTPUTS

#1878 (the 2026W41 metrics update, 2026-10-09 UTC) changed the page and thirteen generated records
under `notes/project-metrics/` and ran the kernel suite, because `.csv` and `.svg` records are not
Markdown and `baseline-drift.md` is named by `script/citations`. The records are written by the
host-only tools above, so they ride the same skip: HOST_ONLY_OUTPUTS lists the one directory those
tools write, and a changed file under it skips when no scanned file outside the tools, their runner
and `.githooks/` names it on a non-comment line.

Unlike the tools rule this check does NOT forgive namers under `script/` and `helpers/`. A gated
script naming a data path on a code line is a read until proven otherwise:
`helpers/verify_times.py` names `falsification-times.tsv` and `verify-runs.csv` precisely because
`script/verify` shards by them (that is why it is not a host-only tool), and those files still run
everything. The one exception is a pathspec exclusion: `script/citations` names
`baseline-drift.md` only inside `:!`, which names a path to not read it, and lint runs citations on
every pull request besides, so a `:!`-prefixed naming does not count. The namers outside the
forgiven set on 2026-10-09 were `helpers/verify_times.py` (the two verify tables, gated) and
`falsifications.yml`, `verify-shard-refresh.yml` and `mutation.yml` (scheduled, none a pull-request
job), each naming its own files, so every record a gated job reads keeps running everything.

# BUGS

- **HOST_ONLY_TOOLS is a hand-kept list, and a script that begins to call a listed tool is not
  seen.** The root check covers callers outside `script/` and `helpers/` only. A new `script/x`
  that runs `script/metrics` and is run by a gated job would let a metrics-only change skip a job
  that now depends on it. None does on 2026-10-07; nothing checks that none does later.
- **HOST_ONLY_OUTPUTS forgives exact-path namings only.** A file under the prefix that nothing
  names by its full path skips: `mutation-survivors/`'s census copies are named by `mutation.yml`
  only through the directory (`git add notes/project-metrics`), so they skip; nothing a pull
  request job runs reads them, and the pull requests that carry them are opened with GITHUB_TOKEN,
  which starts no CI at all. A reference through a runtime-built path or a bare basename is
  equally invisible. A second host-only data directory needs its own row in the list.
- **A directory read outside Rust is logged, not acted on.** A script that walks `design/` (lint's
  roadmap, citations and decisions checks, `helpers/prose_ratchet.py`) is printed as a reader and
  does not stop the skip, because lint runs on every pull request and skipping nothing would be the
  alternative. A script that walks a prose directory and is run *only* by a job the prose path
  skips would slip through. None did on 2026-10-05; nothing checks that none does later.
- **A path built at run time from parts that are not a literal** (an environment variable, a
  `format!` whose pieces are neither a `.md` token nor a quoted prose directory) is invisible. So
  is a reader of the repository root that names it as `""` or `"."`: xtask's `apropos` does, and
  it runs in no gate.
- **A path inside a sentence-shaped string is not counted**, by the rule above, so a shell loop over
  `"notes/a.md notes/b.md"` would read both unseen. Nothing in the tree does that today.
- A script under `notes/` (two `.py` files in `notes/capability-peak-trace/`) is a record and is not
  scanned; if a gate ever ran one, what it reads would be invisible.
- `vendor/` is not scanned. Upstream code names no file of ours.
