# helpers/push-queued-check.sh: refuse a push to a branch whose pull request is in the merge queue.
# Provisional name; milestone: refuse a push to a queued branch (lane/push-while-queued, 2026-10-05 UTC).
#
# Why. A push to a queued branch removes the pull request from the queue (the timeline says
# `RemovedFromMergeQueueEvent`, reason `manual`) and takes its auto-merge with it. The group build
# is thrown away and every group behind it rebuilds. Measured 2026-10-05: 20 of 40 non-merge
# removals in about 28 hours were "manual", and two pull requests lost three entries each in two
# minutes to repeated pushes. See notes/merge-queue.md, "A push to a queued branch".
#
# Usage: the pre-push hook feeds git's ref lines on stdin
# (`<local ref> <local sha> <remote ref> <remote sha>`). Exit 0 lets the push go, exit 1 refuses it.
#
# Override: NIFE_PUSH_QUEUED=1 (provisional name) when the push is meant. `git push --no-verify`
# also works, but skips the other gates too.
#
# Fails open, by design and loudly: no `gh`, no auth, no network, or a blocked GraphQL endpoint (a
# cloud session) prints one warning line and lets the push go. It is one API call per pushed
# branch. Works under sh, bash and zsh (POSIX sh, run by path).

push-queued-check: pull request #$2 for $branch is in the merge queue, and a push removes it.
  The group build is thrown away, auto-merge is cancelled, and every group behind it rebuilds.
  Better: take it out first, push, then arm it again after your LAST push:
    gh api graphql -f query='mutation{dequeuePullRequest(input:{id:"$3"}){clientMutationId}}'
    git push ...
    gh pr merge $2 --auto --merge
  (gh pr merge --disable-auto does nothing here: auto-merge is already null once queued.)
  If this push is intended: NIFE_PUSH_QUEUED=1 git push ...
