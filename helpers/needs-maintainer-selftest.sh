# helpers/needs-maintainer-selftest.sh: the detector's decision (helpers/needs-maintainer.jq), fed
# GraphQL responses in the shape helpers/merge-drain.sh asks for, and the drain checked for still
# asking for every field the decision reads and for never arming or enqueueing. Milestone 727
# (a queue eviction goes to a maintainer session), number provisional. script/lint runs it.
#
# Two fixtures under helpers/needs-maintainer-fixtures/:
#
#   recorded-2026-10-03T23-54-15Z.json   the drain's query, run against the repository at that
#       moment and stored as returned, except that each `body` is emptied (they cite milestones,
#       which script/citations would hold this file to, and none had a `Blocked-by:` line, the
#       only thing the decision reads a body for). #1569 had just been ejected on a
#       `merge_conflict` and read CONFLICTING; everything else was a draft, armed, queued or held. Detection logic that
#       only runs against live GitHub is a defect, so the live shape is pinned here.
#   every-cause.json   one pull request per case, built from recorded event nodes (#1473's
#       `failed_checks` ejection, #1494's `merge_conflict`, #1530's manual dequeue, #1555's stale
#       entry) with the numbers changed so each case stands alone. Cases 20 to 29 are the two
#       causes added on 2026-10-04 (#1640 stacked and unlabelled; #1617 and #1653 red and unowned),
#       built in the same shape. Cases 30 to 37 are `stale-draft` (#1644, 2026-10-05),
#       and 38 and 39 its `parked` exemption (#1745, 2026-10-06), which leave out the
#       label-event alias only `red` reads. Case 40 is case 10 sent back to its lane
#       (`held-by-lane` beside `architect-ruled`, 2026-10-06).
#   orphan.json   the `orphan` cause (lane/orphan-work, 2026-10-06): one branch per shape in the
#       `refs` listing, and the drafts the drain opens for a branch that never had a pull request.
#       Built by hand in the query's shape; the shapes are the 2026-10-06 survey's (#1787).
#   architect.json   the three architect causes (lane/architect-queue, 2026-10-06): the invariant
#       that `needs-architect` sits on exactly the items with an open question, plus a diff the
#       architect-label rules fire on with no hold. Built by hand; the #1783 and #1745 shapes are
#       cases 202 and 212. The drafts keep every other cause quiet. The held nodes in the two
#       fixtures above (10, 26, 34 and the recorded #1564) gained an open ask comment that day, since
#       the recorded query fetched no comments and a hold with no ask is now itself a cause.
#
# The order of the checks is the order of the ruling: the causes, then clearing, then the
# drain's own shape.
