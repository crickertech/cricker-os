PROVISIONAL NAME, minted 2026-10-06 (UTC) by lane/orphan-work; calef has not ruled on it.
Underscores and `.py` because that is how the other Python helpers here are spelled (nanny.py,
runwatch.py).

Why this exists. Every toolchain bump (script/toolchain-bump, and the CI workflow that opens its
pull request) moves `rust-toolchain.toml` to a new `nightly-YYYY-MM-DD`, and rustup installs it the
first time any worktree builds. Nothing ever uninstalls the old one. On 2026-10-06 the maintainer
removed 15 of them by hand and `~/.rustup` went from 44 GB to 14 GB. calef approved making that a
step: stale nightlies go once nothing pins them.

What counts as pinned, and so is never touched:

  - the `channel` in every worktree's `rust-toolchain.toml`, the main checkout included, read from
    `git worktree list` so a lane cut yesterday on an older pin keeps it;
  - Kani's own toolchain. notes/kernel-proofs.md records that Kani bundles its own rustc
    (`kani-0.67.0` pins `nightly-2025-11-21`), and an installed Kani writes that pin to
    `~/.kani/kani-<version>/rust-toolchain-version`. The patched riscv64 Kani
    (notes/kernel-proofs/riscv64-with-a-patched-kani.md) builds from a source tree under
    `~/.cache/nife-kani-riscv64/kani-<version>/src`, whose `rust-toolchain.toml` names its pin. Both
    are read, never hard-coded, so a Kani upgrade moves the pin with it;
  - anything that is not a dated `nightly-*`: `stable`, a numbered release such as `1.98.1`, and
    the `nife-dev-*` links, which are each worktree's std farm (notes/std.md) and not installs.

It runs on this Mac, at prune time (briefs/merge-and-cleanup.md). It cannot live in the CI
toolchain-bump workflow: that runs on a GitHub runner, whose `~/.rustup` is thrown away after every
job, and it never sees this machine's.

BUGS
  - A worktree is the only pin it knows. A branch that is not checked out, or a `cargo +nightly-...`
    typed by hand, pins nothing here; removing its toolchain costs one re-download the next time it
    builds, which is the whole downside.
  - If `~/.kani` exists and no `rust-toolchain-version` file can be read in it, `--remove` refuses
    rather than guess, because a removed Kani toolchain breaks `cargo kani` until `cargo kani setup`
    runs again.
