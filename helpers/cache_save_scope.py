"""A workflow that runs on a merge group saves no rust-cache entry from it, and what `main-caches`
saves is what the other jobs restore.

    helpers/cache_save_scope.py              # script/lint: both rules below
    helpers/cache_save_scope.py --selftest

Name provisional (lane/actions-cache-budget, 2026-10-07 UTC).

# WHY

A run restores caches from its own ref and from the default branch's. Every merge group runs on a
fresh `gh-readonly-queue/main/pr-N-<sha>` ref, so an entry saved there can never be restored by a
later run. On 2026-10-07 the repository held 10.7 GB of caches against GitHub's 10 GB limit; 163
entries (3.8 GB) were rust-cache saves from merge groups, and 111 merge-group jobs sampled that day
restored none. Those entries pushed out the pull request entries that do hit. The measurement is in
notes/actions-cache-budget-2026-10-07.md.

# THE RULE

In every workflow under `.github/workflows/` whose `on:` lists `merge_group`, each step that uses
`Swatinem/rust-cache` sets `save-if:` to an expression that names `merge_group`. The check reads
text, not YAML, because a runner's Python and this Mac's both lack a YAML module; it finds the step
by its `uses:` line and looks for `save-if:` before the next step begins.

# THE SECOND RULE: `main-caches` saves what the restoring jobs read

ci.yml's `main-caches` job (milestone 870 (`main` keeps its CI caches warm), provisional) saves the
QEMU and patched-Kani entries on every push to `main`, so that pull requests and merge groups find
them there. It copies each `actions/cache` step's `path:`, `key:` and pinned `uses:` SHA from the
jobs that restore them. A copy that drifts saves an entry nobody reads, and the slow CI it exists
to prevent comes back with every job still green. So for each `actions/cache` step in
`main-caches`, its restorers are every `actions/cache` step in any other job of any workflow under
`.github/workflows/` (ci.yml, verify.yml and the scheduled workflows that run on `main`) whose
`path:` or `key:` equals the step's. There must be at least one, and each must carry the same
`path:`, `key:` and `uses:` ref, character for character. Matching on either field means a drift in
one of them is still compared rather than silently unmatched; a step that drifts in both has no
restorer, and that fails too. Comparing text rather than evaluated keys is deliberately strict: a
reordered `hashFiles` argument may hash the same, but it is a copy that has stopped being a copy.

# BUGS

- Only rust-cache is covered by the first rule. `actions/cache` steps (QEMU, the patched Kani, the vendor pins) use
  stable keys that hit `main`'s entries, so they save only on a miss. After a key change a merge
  group's save is just as unreachable, so ci.yml's `main-caches` job saves the QEMU and
  patched-Kani keys on every push to `main` (milestone 870 (`main` keeps its CI caches warm),
  provisional), and the second rule holds those keys to the restoring jobs'. The vendor pins are
  left to miss: one HTTP request.
- The check accepts any `save-if:` that mentions `merge_group`, so `== 'merge_group'` passes too. It
  catches a step that forgot the scope, not one that inverted it.
- The second rule compares keys, paths and SHAs, not runners. A restoring job moved to a runner
  pool `main-caches` has no leg for (or a Kani restorer moved off ARM64, where the Kani step runs
  only when `matrix.kani` is set) restores a key `main` never saves, and nothing here notices.
