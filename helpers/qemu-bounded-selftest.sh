# Prove that `helpers/qemu-bounded.sh` still does the four things it exists to do.
#
#     helpers/qemu-bounded-selftest.sh                 test the sibling script
#     helpers/qemu-bounded-selftest.sh path/to/other   test a specific copy (e.g. an old one)
#
# **The name is provisional** (the lane of milestone 226 (`qemu-bounded.sh` leaves an emulator
# behind);
# naming is an architect's call).
#
# # Why a script rather than a paragraph
#
# Every property here is one somebody already lost time to, and every one of them is invisible
# to a reader of the diff. That a bound fires is easy to believe and easy to check. That a
# detached killer survives a `head` which exited, that an orphaned `sleep` does not hold a pipe
# open to the end of the bound, that `perl -e 'alarm'` still cannot bound QEMU: each of those
# was found by a lane losing an afternoon, and each would come back silently under a plausible
# simplification of the script. This is the difference between the properties being tested and
# the properties being remembered.
#
# It is **not wired into any gate**, and that is deliberate rather than an omission. It starts
# real emulators and spends about a minute doing it, so putting it in `script/lint` would tax
# every lane for a script that changes twice a year. Run it when you touch `qemu-bounded.sh`.
#
# # What each case is
#
# 1. **status and promptness.** A child that exits on its own returns its own status, at once.
# 2. **the bound fires on a real QEMU.** The original job.
# 3. **`perl -e 'alarm'` still does not.** The constraint the whole script exists for, checked
#    against the QEMU actually installed rather than against the note that records it.
# 4. **an orphan is not left when the wrapper is killed** (milestone 226). Both the signalled
#    case, where the killer's trap fires, and the SIGKILLed-wrapper case, where only the poll
#    can save it.
# 5. **a pipeline whose reader exits early still gets its emulator killed.** The reason the
#    killer is detached at all.
# 6. **a fast child in a pipeline does not block to the end of the bound** (milestone 38).
# 7. **a failure names who holds the disk image** (milestone 226).
# 8. **and does not name a mere reader**, which is what made the first version of that diagnostic
#    fire on a green `script/test`.
# 9. **the bound reaches an emulator that is not the child** (2026-09-24). `cargo xtask shell` and
#    the x86_64 runner both put QEMU below the process this script starts, and signalling only
#    that process left QEMU under pid 1 every time.
#
# # BUGS
#
# **It cannot test the case that has no fix.** A SIGKILL delivered to the killer as well as the
# wrapper orphans the emulator, and this script does not assert on that because asserting on it
# would only pin a known defect in place. `qemu-bounded.sh`'s own BUGS section records it.
#
# **It finds processes by a `-name` marker containing its own pid**, which is unique in practice
# and not by construction. It kills only by pid, and never anything it did not start, so a
# collision costs a wrong verdict rather than another lane's emulator.
#
# **aarch64 only.** The script under test is architecture-blind, so this checks the property on
# the emulator the dev machine runs. A riscv64 or x86_64 QEMU would exercise the same signal
# handling.
