# helpers/ci-failing.sh: label and comment on a ready pull request whose head is failing a required
# check, so that neither calef nor a maintainer session has to notice.
#
#     helpers/ci-failing.sh              # one pass
#     helpers/ci-failing.sh --dry-run    # one pass, printing every write instead of making it
#
# PROVISIONAL NAMES: this script, `.github/workflows/ci-failing.yml`, helpers/ci-failing.jq and the
# label `ci-failing`. A rename is calef's call. See notes/merge-queue.md.
#
# # Why
#
# calef spotted failing pull request CI twice (#1611, #1597) before any session did, and a session
# may not run a watch loop (the refuse-ci-polling hook), so the watching has to be a workflow.
#
# # What it does
#
# For each open, non-draft pull request, read the check runs on its head commit and keep the ones
# named by the REQUIRED checks of the ruleset on `main`, looked up by API at the start of the pass
# and never hardcoded. The decision, including why a superseded failure does not count, is
# helpers/ci-failing.jq.
#
#   - Failing: add the label, and post one comment per head SHA naming each failing check with its
#     job URL. Deduplicated by a marker holding the SHA, so a head that flaps red, green, red is
#     still announced once, and a new push is a new SHA and a new comment.
#   - Green on every required check it has run: take the label off.
#
# It never dequeues, disables auto-merge, reruns or changes anything else. A queue reports, it does
# not resolve. Drafts are skipped because a draft is its lane's.
#
# # Where it runs
#
# `.github/workflows/ci-failing.yml`, as `nife-smelter[bot]`. From a checkout it is the same pass as
# whatever `gh` is logged in as; use --dry-run first.
