# Fail when a merge changes no file: the tree at TIP equals the tree at BASE.
#
#     helpers/empty-diff-check.sh BASE TIP
#
# Milestone 627 (a pull request that changes nothing does not merge): a pull request that changes nothing does not merge. Run by
# `.github/workflows/empty-diff.yml`, which says what BASE and TIP are for each event, and by
# `helpers/empty-diff-selftest.sh`, which is wired into `script/lint`.
#
# Exit 0: the merge changes something. Exit 1: it changes nothing. Exit 2: BASE or TIP did not
# resolve, which fails the check too, because a required check that fails open is a check that
# examined nothing and reported clean.
#
# **Trees, not diffs.** Two commits have the same tree object exactly when `git diff` between them
# is empty, and comparing the ids needs no file contents, so this works in a `filter: blob:none`
# clone and cannot be fooled by rename detection or whitespace settings.
#
# **Claim commits shape the message and nothing else.** An empty diff is the defect. A pull request
# whose commits are all `claim:` subjects (the §90 (the claim is a draft pull request; the status flip is a gate) convention, an empty commit that opens a lane)
# is its common cause, so that case gets a pointed hint; a claim plus a commit and its revert fails
# the same way with the generic message. See design/roadmap/627-*.md.
#
# Name: provisional, minted 2026-10-02 for milestone 627 (a pull request that changes nothing does not merge); calef has not ruled on it.
