"""helpers/lint_arch_parity.py: every `arch::` path portable kernel code names exists in every port.

CLAUDE.md rule 5 (architectural parity is a gate). `kernel/src/arch/mod.rs` re-exports one port
flat (`pub use aarch64::*;` and its two twins), so the interface the rest of the kernel calls is
an implicit set of shared names, and nothing said the three ports provide the same set. This
check reads that set from the callers and holds each port to it.

What it does, in order:

1. Walks every `.rs` file reached from the module trees of kernel/src (outside kernel/src/arch/)
   and system_tests/src, and collects each `arch::<path>` it names: written out, through a grouped
   `use crate::arch::{...}`, or through a module such a `use` brought in and then named as
   `timer::now`. Comments are stripped first.
2. Works out which architectures can compile each use, from the `#[cfg(...)]` attributes around
   it and on the `mod` declarations that lead to its file. Only `target_arch` is decided; every
   other predicate (a feature, `test`) is treated as possibly true, so a use behind
   `cfg(feature = "bench")` is still required on every port that could turn `bench` on.
3. Resolves the path in each of those ports: arch/mod.rs's own items (with their cfg), then the
   port's mod.rs, following `mod`, `pub use` and glob re-exports. A segment that lands on a
   non-module item (a type, a function) ends the walk, so `HaltReason::measurement_boot` checks
   `HaltReason` and not its methods.
4. Fails on any (path, port) it cannot resolve that ALLOWED below does not name.

What the compiler already catches, and why this is still worth having: script/lint's clippy passes
compile the kernel for all three targets, so an unconditional call to a missing item fails there.
What they do not compile is every feature on every port (seven of the nine boot-mode features are
not built for x86_64; see the x86_64 clippy note in script/lint). A call inside one of those
reaches a port's missing item only when someone first builds that configuration. This check sees
it at once, without cargo, and runs in the pre-push hook.

BUGS: it reads text, not the compiler's name resolution, and it errs both ways.

- It can over-require (a false failure, fixed by an ALLOWED entry): a `#[cfg]` it cannot parse
  counts as "any architecture", and an attribute's reach is approximated (to the item's brace, or
  a `;`, or a `,` in a list), so an odd shape can leave a gated use looking ungated.
- It can under-require (a missed gap; the clippy passes remain the backstop for what they build):
  a port's `pub use` from `crate::`, `super::` or an external crate is trusted without being
  followed; an inline `mod x { ... }` is accepted whole; a top-level macro call whose first
  argument is a name (`linker_symbol!(text_end, ...)`) is taken to define that name; and a port
  item gated on a feature counts as present, since only `target_arch` is decided.
- Names a portable file reaches by a type alias, a macro, or `use crate::arch::*` are not seen.
