# Prove that splitting AGENTS.md into always-loaded rules and on-demand skills deleted nothing.
#
#     helpers/agents-md-split-check.py [<base-rev>]
#
# <base-rev> is the commit whose AGENTS.md is the "before". The default is cde620b1d, the tip of
# lane/agents-md-stale-refs that lane/agents-md-skills branched from on 2026-10-06 (UTC).
#
# Why this exists. calef approved the split on 2026-10-06 (UTC) on one condition: nothing is
# deleted, every sentence moves to exactly one place. A reviewer cannot check that by reading two
# diffs of several thousand words each, and "I moved it all" is rung zero. So this reads every
# sentence of the old file and looks for it, whitespace-, heading- and link-target-insensitively,
# in the union of the new files: AGENTS.md, every notes/skills/*/SKILL.md, and kernel/CLAUDE.md
# if one exists. A sentence found nowhere must be named in CONDENSED below, which is the record of
# what was cut on purpose; one that is missing and unnamed fails, and so does a CONDENSED entry
# that turns out to be present (the list would be lying). For each condensed sentence it also says
# whether design/tenets/ still holds it, since the cut was argued on the tenets holding the reasons.
#
# It checks coverage, not "exactly one place": a sentence present twice passes. The split was built
# from line ranges (each range used once), which is what makes "exactly one" true; this script
# reports duplicates so a reader can see that too.
#
# Name: provisional, minted 2026-10-06 by lane/agents-md-skills; calef has not ruled on it.
#
# BUGS. Sentence splitting is a regex on ". " and friends, so an abbreviation can split a sentence
# in two; both halves are then looked up separately, which can only make the check stricter. It is
# a one-off proof for one change: nothing runs it, and after a later edit to AGENTS.md it will
# report that edit as missing text, correctly but uselessly.

# says its argument and caveats live in AGENTS.md itself, so the tenet does not hold them.
