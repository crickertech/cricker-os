"""The diff-reading half of `needs-architect` (§88): a predicate over a unified diff.

§88 (`needs-architect` as a required check, rather than as a script's restraint) built the
enforcement half -- `architect-hold.yml` fails while the label is present -- and named plainly what
it did not build: *"a check that reads the diff and demands the label when the syscall surface or
the dependency graph moved... the second is the real answer."* `.github/workflows/coe-architect-
label.yml` built that answer for one shape, a correction of error. This is the general one, wired
by `.github/workflows/architect-label.yml`.

This module is a pure predicate: it reads a unified diff (as `git diff --unified=1000000 base head`
produces, so every file's diff is one hunk holding the WHOLE file, changed lines marked) and reports
which of six rules fired, and where. It never runs `git` and never talks to GitHub; the workflow
does both and pipes the diff text in on stdin. That split is what makes `--selftest` below run
against literal fixture strings, no repository and no subprocess required, cheap enough for
`script/lint` to run on every invocation.

    python3 helpers/architect-label-rules.py --selftest        # fixtures; script/lint runs this
    git diff --unified=1000000 BASE HEAD | python3 helpers/architect-label-rules.py
        # prints one "rule: file: line" per match on stdout, exits 0 if anything fired, 1 if
        # nothing did, 2 on a usage error, 3 if it crashed. Nothing here reads BASE/HEAD; a caller
        # diffs first. A crash is 3 rather than Python's own 1 so that it can never read as
        # "nothing fired" (milestone 641 (a mechanism that reports clean says over how many units,
        # and zero is loud), provisional): the workflow routes 2 and 3 to a person.

# The six rules (the brief's wording; this file is the one place that has to agree with it)

1. **abi-surface**: an object type, method number or syscall number moved under `crates/abi/`.
   Detected as any changed `pub const NAME: <int type> = ...` line under that path. Broad on
   purpose: `crates/abi/src/lib.rs` also declares rights bitflags and the register convention's
   constants the same way, so this also fires on those (see BUGS). A false positive there costs a
   human one look; a syscall number landing unlabelled costs more. A removed `pub const A: T = V`
   paired with an added `pub const B: T = V` (same type, same value) is a rename and does not fire;
   a changed value, an added constant with no removed partner, and a deleted one still do.
2. **dependency**: a (name, version requirement) entered a `Cargo.toml` that the base tree does not
   already have. Computed per file as head's external deps minus base's, then dropped if the pair
   is in any manifest at the base revision (vendored ones included) or the name is locked in any
   base `Cargo.lock` at a version the requirement admits. So a dep already in the graph at that
   version does not fire (#1597), a features-only change does not, a `path = ` entry never counts,
   and a dep moved to a version nothing at the base uses DOES fire. The base comes from
   `--base-rev REV`; without it nothing is known and every changed dependency fires. See BUGS for
   what "external" cannot see: a multi-line inline table.
3. **format-crate**: a version constant, magic value, or documented on-disk layout moved in a crate
   that is classified, from its own head content, as a format crate: it declares a `pub const`
   ending in `VERSION` or `MAGIC`, or its module doc carries a markdown table with a `version`
   column (the two tells the brief names). Firing is on a changed `VERSION`/`MAGIC` constant line, or
   a changed doc or block comment line (`//!`, `///`, `/* */`) outside test code that states a
   layout (a markdown table row, `offset`, `width`, `bit N`, an `N..M` range). A plain `//`
   comment, a line under `#[test]` or `#[cfg(test)]`, and a removed/added pair with the same
   numbers and layout words (an identifier renamed in the sentence) do not fire.
4. **spawnproto**: a `pub const` changed in a file named `spawnproto.rs` (the wire layout
   `crates/grant_plan/src/spawnproto.rs` documents; matched by filename rather than the one path in
   the tree today, so a second one elsewhere is still caught). Same-value renames pair off as in
   rule 1.
5. **decisions**: `CLAUDE.md` changed at all, or a `design/decisions/*.md` file (excluding the
   generated `README.md`) changed OUTSIDE its YAML frontmatter block (the first `---`-delimited
   section). A frontmatter-only edit (a status flip, a date) is provenance, not the decision's
   substance, and does not fire; see the frontmatter shape in any decision file's first lines.
6. **syscall-error**: a changed code line in `kernel/src/syscall.rs` (or a future
   `kernel/src/syscall/`) that names an `Error::` variant: a method returns an error it did not, or
   stops returning one. Added by lane/architect-queue, 2026-10-06 (UTC), after #1745's forged-cursor
   refusal went unlabeled. A line removed and re-added verbatim (a move) pairs off; comments do
   not count. Measured over the 31 merges that touched the file from 2026-09-01 to 2026-10-06: it
   fires on 13 (#1678 #1665 #1644 #1630 #1360 #1418 #1383 #1378 #1351 #1373 #1366 #1372 #882), and
   5 of those were labeled at the time. calef ruled the breadth on #1792, 2026-10-06 (UTC): "Keep
   it broad." The other 8, classified by reading each fired diff, so a later narrowing is measured:
     changed what a caller can receive (4): #1351 (notification methods, new NotPermitted and
       WrongObject), #1373 (`RETYPE` takes a count; OutOfMemory on zero), #1372 (a per-client
       window refuses with NotPermitted), #882 (port-range methods, NotPermitted and BadMethod);
     false alarms, a refactor returning the same error on the same path (4): #1644
       (`current_cap` moved onto the revocation hold), #1630 (lookup code moved to `sched.rs`),
       #1366 (the capability-table-full path restructured), #1665 (`retype_page` hoisted out of
       a closure, still OutOfMemory).
   Narrowing to added lines would keep all 4 true ones and drop only #1630 of the false ones.

# Measured rate, 2026-10-04 UTC

The bot's own comments on the 70 most recent PRs labelled `needs-architect` or `architect-ruled`
(one count per PR per rule; "true" means a new or changed wire value, syscall number, dependency new
to the graph, or a decisions edit):

    rule          true  false  the false ones
    abi-surface      2      1  #1584 rename, value unchanged
    dependency       1      1  #1597 redox_syscall 0.9.0, already in three manifests
    format-crate     2      7  `//!` prose (#1289 #1369 #1374 #1443 #1511 #1527), a diagram (#1584); now quiet, #1402 still fires
    spawnproto       3      3  #1377 #1419 #1421: IMAGE_MAX_PAGES, not in those PRs' diffs (not reproduced)
    decisions       23      0  by definition; about 7 are link or rename sweeps (#1369 #1371 #1374 #1427 #1510 #1527 #1289)

Narrowed on this evidence: rules 1, 2, 3 and 4 (above). Not narrowed: decisions (a sweep is still
an edit to a ratified record).

# format-crate's second narrowing, measured 2026-10-08 UTC

calef on #1838's hold: "Please deal with the false positives." It fired on a `//` line beside a
test's assert (`... the 1900-to-1970 offset ...`); no constant, field or layout moved. Rule 3 rerun
over every merge from 2026-09-12 to 2026-10-07 (1,000 pull requests) plus #1838: 29 file firings.
13 fire on a `VERSION`/`MAGIC` constant line and are untouched. The other 16 fired on a comment
alone, classified by reading each diff:

    class                                        n  kept  the pull requests
    layout table edited (true)                   3     3  #1402 #1385 #1360 (manifest_note rows)
    true by coincidence (a const moved, the      3     2  kept #1727 (PUT_REFUSED) #1066 (PAGE_VA);
      comment that matched was unrelated)                 dropped #1352 (PAGE_VA, matched in a test)
    false, `//` comment or test code             3     0  #1838 #1569 #805
    false, identifier renamed in the sentence    3     0  #1255, #860 (two files)
    false, still firing                          4     4  #1088 (a cost table), #927 #853 #1067 (prose)

So 7 of 29 file firings drop (6 false, plus #1352's coincidental catch), every layout-table edit
still fires, and #1402's class is in the fixtures. #1352 shows the real gap, now in BUGS: a format
crate's other `pub const` values are not read at all.

# BUGS

- **Renames pair by one-line value text.** `pub const A: u64 = 1;` against `pub const B: u64 = 1;`
  pairs; a `const` whose initializer spans lines, or whose type differs, never does (it fires). A
  pair of unrelated constants that swap to each other's spelling at equal values would pass; that is
  a rename by definition.
- **Rule 2's lock test is caret-only.** A requirement with a comma, operator or wildcard is never
  matched against a lockfile (it fires unless an identical manifest entry exists).
- **syscall-error reads one file.** An error moved into a helper the dispatcher calls (`revoke.rs`,
  `sched.rs`) is missed, and a refactor that rewrites a line holding `Error::` fires. Both measured
  at zero and unknown respectively on the 31 merges above; revisit on the first miss.
- **format-crate reads only `VERSION`/`MAGIC` constants.** A format crate's other wire values
  (#1352 and #1066 moved `PAGE_VA`, #1727 added `PUT_REFUSED`) fire only if an unrelated layout
  comment happens to change beside them, and #1352's no longer does. Unmeasured beyond those three;
  firing on every `pub const` in a format crate is the obvious widening and has not been tried.
- **The test-code mask counts braces.** A raw string or a multi-line string holding an unbalanced
  `{` or `}` misplaces where a test module ends. Leaving a test region late hides a layout comment
  after it; the fixtures cover one-line strings and char literals only.
- **format-crate's layout-comment test is a regex.** A layout described in a comment without a
  table row, offset, width, bit number or `N..M` range (say, a prose paragraph that moves a field)
  is missed unless a constant moves with it. Residual and unmeasured: the table-row form is the one
  this tree's layouts use (#1402); revisit if a layout change slips by.
