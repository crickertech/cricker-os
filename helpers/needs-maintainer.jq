# helpers/needs-maintainer.jq: which pull requests a maintainer session must pick up, and why.
#
# Milestone 727 (a queue eviction goes to a maintainer session), number provisional. calef's ruling
# on #1564, 2026-10-03 UTC: "I don't want the job of watching the queue." That day he was the
# queue's only working detector, while the drain re-armed and re-queued on his behalf and commented
# where nobody looked. So the drain stopped acting on the queue, and this decides the one thing it
# still owes: a label, `needs-maintainer` (name provisional), on a pull request a maintainer
# session must pick up, so the session finds it in the `needs-maintainer` listing
# (briefs/session-start.md) and not by watching. Nothing here arms, enqueues or re-queues; it only names.
#
# Fifteen causes, each a fact nothing else reports to anyone:
#
#   ejected   the last removal from the queue was neither `merged` nor `manual`, nothing put it
#             back since, and the head is still the one that was ejected. A removal whose event
#             names no group commit (a `merge_conflict`) cannot say which head it was, so it holds
#             until the conflict is gone instead. `manual` is excluded because a person, or the
#             drain's own `dequeue_held`, took it out on purpose; the `unarmed` cause catches it 30
#             minutes later if nobody follows up.
#   conflict  ready, and `mergeable` is CONFLICTING against `main`.
#   stale     a merge-queue entry whose pull request is no longer open. #1555 had one on
#             2026-10-03: enqueued in the same second it merged, and removed by hand 15 minutes
#             later. A closed pull request is never in `gh pr list`'s default listing, which is why
#             the session's command says `--state all`.
#   unarmed   ready, not armed, not in the queue, for `$minutes` (30, calef's figure) since the
#             latest of: it was opened, it was marked ready, auto-merge was disabled, it left the
#             queue. A lane arms in the same command as `gh pr ready`, so this is the one that
#             forgot. Not raised beside `ejected` or `conflict`, which already say what is wrong,
#             nor while a `Blocked-by:` pull request is still open, which is an unarmed pull
#             request waiting on purpose.
#   off-main  ready, not armed, and based on a branch other than `main`, for `$minutes` since it
#             was opened or marked ready. The merge queue drains `main` only, so nothing will ever
#             merge this, and `eligible` (below) never shows it to the other causes. #1640 on
#             2026-10-04: stacked on #1630's branch, green and mergeable, and labeled by nothing
#             for about three hours until calef merged it into its base by hand. A `Blocked-by:`
#             pull request still open holds it, as it holds `unarmed`.
#   red       wearing `ci-failing` (helpers/ci-failing.sh decides that, from the required checks
#             on the head) for `$minutes` since the label last went on. That label is a report with
#             no reader: a lane that ended `WAITING` is not running, and a session's queue is this
#             label, so #1617 and #1653 sat armed and red on 2026-10-04 until calef pointed at them.
#             Armed or not, any base: an armed pull request whose checks fail never enters the
#             queue, so nothing else here would see it. A push clears `ci-failing` until its checks
#             fail, and a fresh label starts a fresh episode.
#   stale-draft  a draft from this repository whose head commit is `nm_stale_draft_hours` (6,
#             calef's figure, 2026-10-05) old by its committer date. Not `updatedAt`, which every
#             bot comment and every retarget bumps. #1644 had no commit after 2026-10-04 22:11 UTC
#             once its lane's session ended, and every other cause skips a draft. A draft holding
#             only its claim commit is not exempt: that is the clearest case of a lane that died.
#             An open `Blocked-by:` holds it, as it holds `unarmed`, and so does `nm_parked_label`.
#   unmergeable  an open pull request whose merge-queue entry reads `UNMERGEABLE`: GitHub cannot
#             build it on top of the entries ahead of it, usually because it conflicts with one of
#             them rather than with `main`, so `conflict` never fires. The queue does not eject such
#             an entry; it leaves it waiting. #1795 sat like that behind #1745 on 2026-10-07 (UTC),
#             conflicting in notes/package-boundaries.md, until calef found it on the queue page.
#             Keyed on the pull request's head, so one comment per head and a new one after a push
#             that does not fix it.
#   orphan   a branch holding work that no open pull request carries, for `nm_orphan_hours` (2,
#             the 2026-10-06 brief's figure) by its tip's committer date. calef, 2026-10-06 UTC: "It
#             seems like we have some work trees that don't have PRs. That seems like a problem that
#             leads to lack of visibility and progress on that work." Keyed on remote branches,
#             because they are the ledger every session can see. A branch is in scope unless it is
#             `main` or a `gh-readonly-queue/*` candidate, and it holds work when its tip is not an
#             ancestor of `main` (`compare.behindBy`, the commits it has that `main` lacks). Three
#             shapes, each labeled where a session already looks:
#               - its last pull request merged, and commits were pushed past the merged head:
#                 the merged pull request, closed, wears the label (`--state all` finds it);
#               - its last pull request closed without merging: the closed one wears it;
#               - it never had a pull request: there is nothing to label, so the decision says
#                 `adopt` and the shell opens a draft for it, marked with `nm_orphan_marker` and the
#                 head it adopted. That draft carries the cause until its head moves, it is made
#                 ready, or it closes (after which the closed shape applies to the branch).
#             `parked` (`nm_parked_label`) on the last pull request exempts all three, as it
#             exempts `stale-draft`: a branch kept on purpose, such as argon's waiting for a board
#             (#1738, #1732). Deleting the branch, landing it, or opening a pull request for it
#             takes the label off. The 2026-10-06 survey that prompted this is in #1787.
#   missing-check  armed, ready, and a required status check of the `main` ruleset has no check run
#             at all at the head, although every pull-request workflow run there has finished and the
#             drain has already rerun the owning workflow once (helpers/missing-check.jq decides that
#             half; the shell splices its verdict into the node as `missingChecks`). #1814 on
#             2026-10-07 (UTC): CI finished `failure` with every job green, and the required cpu
#             matrix job was never created. Keyed on the head, so one comment per head.
#   stuck-head  a merge-queue entry that reads `AWAITING_CHECKS` although every workflow run of its
#             merge group has completed, and the last of them did so `nm_stuck_head_minutes` (10)
#             ago. #1824 sat at the head of the queue from 16:38 to 19:42 UTC on 2026-10-07: its
#             runs were done by 17:01, CI and verify `failure` with every listed job green, so a
#             required check never posted and GitHub neither merged nor ejected it, and everything
#             behind it waited until the maintainer dequeued it by hand. The shell splices each
#             `AWAITING_CHECKS` entry's verdict (helpers/stuck-head.jq) into the entry as
#             `stuckHead`. **The one cause the drain acts on.** calef ruled on #1833 (2026-10-07 UTC)
#             that the drain recovers a stuck head itself, a narrow exception to #1564: the FIRST
#             stall of a pull request is `stuck-head-requeue`, which carries no label and makes the
#             shell dequeue the entry and enqueue it again at the back. A SECOND stall (the drain's
#             own earlier `needs-maintainer:stuck-head` comment is on the pull request) is plain
#             `stuck-head`: label and comment, no re-queue. Keyed on the group's head commit, so
#             every stall gets its own comment. Do not extend this to another cause.
#   hold-no-ask, ask-no-hold, surface-no-hold   the architect queue's invariant broken
#             (lane/architect-queue, 2026-10-06; definitions above `nm_decide`): `needs-architect`
#             with no open question, an open question without it, and a diff the architect-label
#             rules fire on with no hold or ruling label. They apply to drafts and held items too,
#             and the first two to open issues as well as pull requests.
#   budget   an open issue wearing `nm_budget_label`: a CI job's merge-group runs have passed about
#             85% of its milestone 721 (each merge-group CI job has a 20-minute budget) budget, and
#             `helpers/ci_job_times.py sync` opened the issue (milestone 808 (every gate accounts for
#             its time), §254 (a gate prints what each item cost)). calef ruled on 2026-10-06 (UTC)
#             that the issue must reach a session through this listing, because a label nothing
#             queries is rung zero. Keyed on the issue's number and the time it was opened, so one
#             comment per episode; the issue closing (the job back under the line) clears the label.
#
# `ejected`, `conflict` and `unarmed` apply only to what `eligible` admits (helpers/queue-eligible.jq,
# spliced in front of this file); `off-main` and `red` to a ready pull request from this repository
# on any base; `stale-draft` to a draft from this repository on any base. None of those applies to
# one held with `needs-architect` or `held-for-red-trunk`, and only `stale` and `stale-draft` apply
# to a draft: a draft is its lane's while the lane is alive (converting an ejected pull request to a
# draft is how a lane says it has it), a fork's pull request is a person's decision, and a held one
# is waiting on purpose. `stale` and `unmergeable` read the queue, not the pull request, and apply to
# whatever entry is there.
#
# A cause carries `key`, which names the episode: the ejection's time, the conflicting head, the
# entry's enqueue time, the unmergeable head, the moment it was last unarmed or made ready, the
# moment `ci-failing` went on, the draft's last commit. The shell posts one comment per cause per
# key, deduplicated by a marker in the comment, so a persisting cause never comments twice and a
# new episode does.
#
# Input: the GraphQL response the drain asks for (helpers/merge-drain.sh, `nm_query`), and:
#   $label     the label's name
#   $now       epoch seconds
#   $minutes   the grace before `unarmed`, `off-main` or `red`
#   $blockers  { "<number>": ["OPEN", "MERGED", ...] }, the states of the pull requests a ready
#              pull request's `Blocked-by:` line names (the shell resolves them; this file must
#              not call `gh`)
#
# Output, one object per pull request that has a cause or wears the label:
#   { number, kind: "pr" | "issue", action: "label" | "keep" | "clear" | "hold", hold: bool,
#     causes: [ { cause, key, ... } ] }
# `hold` true means the shell adds `needs-architect` (the architect causes, below).

# The three architect causes. calef's queue is `needs-architect`, and it is complete and honest only
