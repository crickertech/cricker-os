# (script/lint --baselines): a pin that moves without its floors is the one gate failure that
# is about tree state rather than code shape, so no code-level hook could see it, and #1463's
# first push reached CI red on it. script/lint still runs this file in its full pass; there is
# one copy of the check and two doors into it.

A compiler bump changes the instruction sequences these floors count, so the
numbers are revalued by a change no commit in this branch is responsible for.
The bump workflow's restamp job carries a floor across when it proves the
compiler moved no row by 0.5% or more (its table is in the pull request body).
Every floor named above is one it could not carry. Re-record it HERE, in the
branch that raises the pin, so the delta is seen by the person causing it:

    script/bench --save --why "nightly-<date>: <what the new compiler moved>"
    script/bench --riscv --save --why "..."
    script/bench --x86 --save --why "..."

--why is not optional: a floor records the reason it holds its value, beside the
number, because a commit message is read once on the day it is written (milestone
302). Say the same thing in the commit message. If a floor moved a lot, that is the
gate working: a nightly can make this kernel genuinely slower, and re-recording
without reading the delta is the one outcome this refuses to automate.""", file=sys.stderr)
