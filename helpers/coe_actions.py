"""A correction of error's action items: each one resolved to a file, and counted open or closed.

**Why this exists.** calef, reviewing #1513 on 2026-10-03 (UTC): *"How do we ensure these don't get
lost in the backlog so we prioritize them? Do we need to track open COE action items in the metrics
so that we can drive the count down?"* §210 (a correction of error, and its action items are
decisions, proposals or milestones) ruled what an action item may be, and proposed, without a
ruling, that a gate check it by reusing the `## Follow-on` vocabulary `script/roadmap` already
validates. Nothing built that gate, and the first two corrections wrote their action items as prose
under a `## The mechanism` heading, where no script could find them. This is the gate and the count,
in one place, so that `script/roadmap --check` (which fails a COE whose item resolves to nothing)
and `script/metrics` (which charts how many are still open each week) cannot disagree about what an
item is or whether it is done.

**The vocabulary is not copied.** A bullet is matched by `roadmap_block.DISPOSITION`, the regex the
`## Follow-on` check uses, so a word added there is a word a COE can use, and a COE bullet the regex
does not know is a failure rather than a silent pass. What differs from a milestone block is
resolution, and §210 named the differences:

- `**None.**` is refused. A correction that identified nothing to change has not finished.
- `**Outstanding.**` is refused. It is a PARTIAL block's word for its own scope, and a COE has none.
- Everything else resolves to something a reader can open, and that thing says whether it is done.

**Open or closed**, which is the whole of the count:

| opener | resolves to | open while |
|---|---|---|
| `**Milestone N.**` | `design/roadmap/N-*.md` | its status is not BUILT, REMOVED, SUPERSEDED, REFUSED or RECORDED |
| `**Proposed.**` | a file under `design/roadmap/proposals/` | it is still a proposal; once promoted (deleted, and a block says `promoted_from` its slug) it is that milestone |
| `**Decision.**` | a file under `design/decisions/` | its status is PROPOSED |
| `**Done.**`, `**Recorded.**`, `**Refused.**` | prose of at least 40 characters | never: these say the item is finished |

A promoted proposal is followed rather than reported as a dead link, because promotion deletes the
file (calef, 2026-09-18) and the promoting lane cannot be expected to know which corrections cite
it. The gate stays exact anyway: a `Proposed.` file that is gone and that no block was promoted from
is a failure.

**What a correction is**: every `notes/coes/*.md` except the README. Each has exactly one
`## Action items` section.

Name: provisional, minted by the lane revising #1513 on 2026-10-03 (UTC). A shared python module
under `helpers/`, which `script/names` puts out of its own scope, so this paragraph is the record.
`coe` is the directory's own provisional abbreviation (`notes/coes/README.md`).

BUGS

- The per-opener resolution for `Recorded.`, `Done.` and `Refused.` (a 40-character floor) repeats
  `script/roadmap`'s `## Follow-on` loop rather than sharing it. §210 proposed factoring that loop
  and calling it twice; this module is the second caller written first, and folding the
  `## Follow-on` check onto it is left undone because that loop also carries milestone-only rules.
  An exception, and a foot gun: a change to the floor there must be made here too.
- Open means "the file it names says it is not done". A milestone marked BUILT that did not fix the
  correction's cause counts as closed. No script can tell, and §210 says so about itself.
