# helpers/architect-label-comment.sh: post .github/workflows/architect-label.yml's one finding
# comment, marker-guarded so a pull request gets it once, ever.
#
# Pulled out of the workflow file rather than written inline in its `run:` block for a mechanical
# reason, not a style preference: a YAML block literal (`run: |`) requires every line of its body
# to be indented at least as much as the block's own indentation, and a multi-line comment body
# with a fenced code block starting in column 1 breaks that the moment it is written the way a
# human would write a comment. A plain shell script has no such constraint, so the body is written
# here the way it will actually render.
#
# The marker-guard is `helpers/merge-drain.sh`'s own `notify()`, copied rather than re-invented:
# check the pull request's comments for an HTML comment marker before posting, so a later push
# that trips a second rule does not bury the first finding under a duplicate. This marker is a
# single constant rather than one per rule (unlike `merge-drain.sh`'s per-stall marker), matching
# `.github/workflows/coe-architect-label.yml`'s own restraint: this job never removes the label, so
# there is nothing for a second comment to add once the first has named a reason.
#
# Usage: helpers/architect-label-comment.sh <pr-number> <owner/repo> <report>
#   <report>  the rule engine's own output, one "rule: file: detail" line per match
#
# Needs `gh`, authenticated (the workflow passes GH_TOKEN); needs jq for the marker check, same as
# merge-drain.sh's notify(). Never exits non-zero: a failed comment is logged and swallowed, same
# reasoning as architect-label.yml's own label step, and the same as coe-architect-label.yml's
# label step gives in full: no correction of error, and by extension no diff finding, should ever
# be blocked from existing because an API call to post a comment failed.

# Name: provisional, minted by this lane, 2026-09-27. Hyphenated per design/naming.md's `helpers/`
# entry-point rule; calef has not ratified it.

\`needs-architect\` was added because this diff matched \`helpers/architect-label-rules.py\`. What calef is asked, one question per finding:

$questions

An answer is the ruling, and "no, nothing like that moved" on a false positive is one too: the maintainer records it with \`script/record-ruling $pr_number --text '<his words>'\`, which swaps the label for \`architect-ruled\`. Removing \`needs-architect\` by hand does not stick, because the merge drain adds it back while a rule still fires. The rules and their known false positives are in that file's docstring.

A lane that knows more than the rule does should post its own ask under a \`## What I need from you\` heading (notes/skills/decisions/SKILL.md); a hold with no such ask is flagged \`needs-maintainer\` (\`hold-no-ask\`) after 30 minutes.
