"""How much of what enters the merge queue leaves without merging, day by day.

Milestone 724 (the merge queue reports its ejection share and its time to merge), provisional
number. Name provisional.

# WHY

calef asked whether merges were slow before the Claude allowance ran out. They were, and nothing
could have said so. From GitHub's merge-queue events, entries that left without merging went from 8%
(2026-09-15 to 09-19) to 43% (09-22 to 09-27), and a week of that read as an ordinary busy week.
Milestone 630 (a merge-queue ejection is caught before the queue, and recovered after it) handles
each ejection as it happens. Nothing counted them.

# WHAT IT COUNTS

Per UTC day, from each pull request's merge-queue timeline events (GraphQL `AddedToMergeQueueEvent`
and `RemovedFromMergeQueueEvent`, whose `reason` is `merged` on success and `failed_checks`,
`merge_conflict`, `manual` and so on otherwise):

- `entries`: Added events that day.
- `ejected`: Removed events that day whose reason is not `merged`. A pull request ejected three times
  counts three, because each is a group that was built and thrown away.
- `ejection_pct`: ejected over entries, to one place. It can pass 100 on a day whose ejections are
  mostly of the previous day's entries; that is the arithmetic and not an error.
- `merged`, `median_hours_to_merge`: pull requests merged that day, and the median hours from the
  pull request being opened to its merge. Blank when none merged.

An ejection is attributed to the day it happened and an entry to the day it entered, so a pull
request that enters at 23:50 and is ejected at 00:10 moves one number on each side of midnight.

# HOW THE NUMBER REACHES `script/metrics`

`script/metrics` reads git and committed records, and a GitHub API fetch is neither. So the fetch
is this helper's, run by the weekly-metrics workflow before `script/metrics --update`, and it
writes `notes/project-metrics/merge-queue-daily.csv`. `script/metrics` reads that file the way it
reads `effort.csv`, a committed record of a fact it cannot re-derive, and sums it into weekly
columns. That is the cheapest honest path: no new carried column, no second fetch, and a week the
fetch never ran for is left empty rather than zeroed. The alternative was passing the figure in
with a flag the way `--coverage-from` does, which needs the number to be one value per run and this
is a series.

# THE REPORT

`report` fetches the last few days live (not from the CSV, which only moves when a metrics pull
request merges) and prints a line for each day with at least `MIN_ENTRIES` entries whose share is
over `THRESHOLD_PCT`. `trunk-health` runs it. 20% is calef's number: no day from 09-15 to 09-19
reached it and every day from 09-22 to 09-26 did.

# BUGS

- The fetch pages pull requests newest-updated first and stops at the first one last updated before
  the window, on the premise that a queue event updates the pull request. Checked on 2026-10-03 by
  reproducing the proposal's figures (see the milestone 724 block). A pull request touched by
  nothing since a queue event inside the window would be missed if that premise ever fails.
- A pull request with more than `TIMELINE_CAP` queue events has its newest `TIMELINE_CAP` read, which
  covers any recent window; the helper says so on stderr in the rare case the window reaches the oldest
  event read. Truncation is decided by `hasPreviousPage`, not `totalCount`, which overcounts the
  filtered types (2026-10-03: #1377, #1062, #970 and #546 read 101 to 119 and returned 2, 86, 8 and
  74 nodes, none truncated).
- `report` re-announces every time `trunk-health` runs, for the reason trunk-health.yml's BUGS gives
  for a red trunk: a scheduled run has no memory. A bad day is a warning on every run until the day
  rolls over.
