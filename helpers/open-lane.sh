# Run one mechanical lane against a rented open-weight model instead of Claude.
#
#     helpers/open-lane.sh <worktree> <brief-file> [max-rounds]
#
# **Why this exists.** DECISIONS 202 routes mechanical work to a cheaper model and DECISIONS 203
# rules that capacity is rented rather than bought. Neither was built: on 2026-09-21 about 6% of
# five million lane tokens went anywhere other than the expensive model, and calef's limit is a rate
# limit rather than a bill, so the wall arrives on a date rather than in an invoice.
#
# **One process talks to one provider.** Claude Code resolves the endpoint once at startup, and a
# subagent's `model` field accepts only Claude aliases, so a session cannot send some lanes
# elsewhere. That is why this is a separate headless process per lane rather than a flag.
#
# **The gates are the oracle, and that is the whole safety argument.** A cheaper model is safe here
# exactly to the extent that a shell command says pass or fail. This script never judges the work:
# it loops the model against `script/lint` and `script/citations --ratchet` until they exit 0 or the
# round budget runs out, and a lane that cannot reach green is handed back rather than merged.
#
# # SETUP
#
# The provider must speak the **Anthropic Messages API** (`POST /v1/messages`). Open-weight
# providers are OpenAI-shaped, so a translating gateway sits in between; LiteLLM is the one the
# Claude Code documentation names. Set these before running:
#
#     export OPEN_LANE_BASE_URL=https://<cordoba>.<tailnet>.ts.net:4000
#     export OPEN_LANE_MODEL=<model id the gateway exposes>
#     export OPEN_LANE_EFFORT=low                        # optional; see below
#
# **`OPEN_LANE_EFFORT`** is passed straight through as `claude --effort <level>`. The CLI accepts
# `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` or `max` (`claude --help`); this script does not second-guess that
# list, so a typo here is the CLI's error to report, not this script's to pre-validate. Default is
# `low`, and the reason is a measured null result rather than a guess: notes/effort-levels.md ran a
# real, checkable repository query at all five levels, twice each, and every level answered
# identically, including the ambiguous first version of the task where all five made the same wrong
# call and the correct second version where all five got it exactly right. Higher effort bought more
# wall-clock (about 5x from low to max) and more turns, not more correctness. **That measurement ran
# directly against Claude, not through this gateway against an open-weight model**, because this lane
# had no OpenRouter credentials; whether `--effort` does anything at all once LiteLLM's
# `drop_params: true` has a chance to strip it for a model that does not know the parameter is
# unmeasured. Override per run (`OPEN_LANE_EFFORT=max helpers/open-lane.sh ...`) for a lane worth
# spending more on, and re-measure against the real backend before trusting this default there.
#
# The gateway has no password of its own (notes/open-model-lanes.md), but Claude Code under
# `--bare` still insists on *some* credential, so this sends a placeholder. It is not a secret and
# the gateway ignores it.
#
# # BUGS
#
# - **Tool-call fidelity is the unknown and is not this script's to promise.** Claude Code sends
#   tool definitions in Anthropic's schema; the gateway translates them, and whether a given
#   open-weight model emits well-formed calls turn after turn is a property of that model. Nothing
#   in the documentation vouches for it. Benchmark before trusting: `--dry-run` prints the command.
# - **Prompt caching is billed as a miss.** Claude Code sends `cache_control` regardless, and a
#   gateway that does not implement it bills every turn uncached. The per-token estimate in
#   DECISIONS 203 assumed nothing about caching, so it is not wrong, but a cached-rate quote is.
# - **The context window is guessed at 200K** for a model id Claude Code does not recognise. Set
#   `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` if the real window is smaller, or the run truncates mid-task.
# - **`--bare` skips CLAUDE.md, skills, hooks and plugins.** That is deliberate here: a mechanical
#   lane should be told what to do by its brief, and the constitution is 924 lines that a cheap
#   model would spend its window on. It also means this lane does not inherit the rules, so the
#   brief has to carry whatever it needs.
# - **The gate lock covers the gate machinery, not every way to quiet a check.** A lane cannot
#   change a verdict by editing `script/`, `helpers/`, `.github/`, `.cargo/`, the lint and format
#   configs, or the prose baseline, but `Cargo.toml` is outside the set because lanes legitimately
#   add dependencies, and a `#[allow]` in source silences clippy for one item. The lock stops the
#   failure we measured (a lane disabling the check it was asked to fix), not a determined one.
#   A `Gate target:` line reopens the hole for exactly the file it names; that is the price of
#   letting a lane fix a gate at all.
#
# # THE GATE LOCK
#
# On 2026-09-27 a rented model, asked to make `script/citations --ratchet` ignore moved lines,
# wrote a change that matched every added line against itself, so the ratchet passed everything,
# including fresh unglossed citations, and the gate it had disabled then said green. So a lane's
# work is judged in two steps, and neither trusts the lane's own tree:
#
# 1. **Refuse.** A committed change to a gate path (`GATE_PATHS` below) fails the round, unless the
#    brief names that file on a line of its own, `Gate target: script/citations`, as the thing the
#    task is to change. The lane is told which file it touched.
# 2. **Judge from a clean copy.** The gates run in a throwaway worktree checked out at the lane's
#    committed HEAD. Uncommitted edits, including an uncommitted edit to `script/lint`, cannot reach
#    the verdict, and the gate machinery there is byte-for-byte the base commit's, apart from the
#    files a brief named.
#
# A lane can still commit a wrong fix to a named target and pass with it. That is why a named
# target is rare and a reviewer reads it; see notes/open-model-lanes.md.
