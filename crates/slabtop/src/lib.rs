//! **`slabtop`: where this prompt's job budget went, by kind of kernel object** (milestone 126 (the `procps` package),
//! DECISIONS §225 (`free` sees the machine and your share)).
//!
//! Upstream `slabtop` ranks the kernel's slab caches by the memory each holds. This kernel has no
//! slab: milestone 14 (kernel objects from untyped) removed its heap, and a kernel object is carved
//! from a region its holder owns. So the question §225 kept is the same one asked of a budget
//! instead of a kernel: of the pages this prompt's jobs have spent, how many went to threads, to
//! address spaces, to rendezvous objects, and to plain frames. The figures are
//! `MemoryRegion::USAGE` on a view of the budget narrowed to `ENUMERATE`, summed by the kernel over
//! every job region carved from it.
//!
//! The program's logic lives here so it runs on the host; `components/src/slabtop.rs` asks the
//! kernel seven questions and writes this.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//! $ slabtop
//! job budget: 80 of 512 pages spent
//!    PAGES      KIB  SPENT ON
//!       60      240  frames
//!        4       16  threads
//!        4       16  address spaces
//!        2        8  rendezvous
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - The counts say where pages went, not what is alive: a region's pages are spent until the
//!   region is reclaimed, so a job that ended and was reaped leaves nothing, and a thread that died
//!   inside a live job still counts.
//! - It does not refresh, for `vmstat`'s reason (milestone 106 (a wait that ends on either the interrupt or the deadline)).
//! - It counts `slabtop` itself, which is one of the jobs.
//! - The breakdown need not sum to the pages spent: a job region's unspent pages are spent from the
//!   budget's point of view and on nothing from the job's.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-27 (calef, #1360's table), though it was flagged harder than `free`'s:
//! the upstream name promises a kernel-wide cache view, and this is one budget's breakdown.
