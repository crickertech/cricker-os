//! **The system log's wire contracts**: milestone 613 (a system log service: the in-memory half),
//! for §242 (a system log).
//!
//! Three things two programs agree on, so by AGENTS.md rule 7 one crate rather than copies:
//!
//! - [`record`]: **F3**, the binary record. A 32-byte header the service (or, from milestone 342
//!   (the kernel and the `console` server drive one UART from two address spaces), the kernel)
//!   writes, then up to [`record::TEXT_MAX`] bytes of text. It is the transport, never
//!   the stored form: the service converts it to one JSON object per line before storing it
//!   (§242, Question 3 as ruled).
//! - [`control`]: what the spawner that minted a writer's badge tells the service about it (which
//!   program, which user, which stream), sent through the **unbadged** intake capability, which is
//!   what makes the spawner the only one who can say it.
//! - [`read`]: how a reader asks for records and where they land: a page shared with the service,
//!   one per reader, filled with whole JSONL lines.
//!
//! What a *writer* sends is not here. A writer speaks the byte sink (`crates/byte_sink_protocol`),
//! whose first word's spare bits carry a severity and a body kind since §242 amended it; that is
//! the whole point of the shape, because a program that already prints can be given the log
//! instead of a terminal and change nothing.
//!
//! # Attribution, and why the writer cannot lie about it
//!
//! Every field of a record but the text is filled by the service from the badge on the capability
//! the writer invoked. The kernel stamps that badge (`abi::rendezvous::BADGE`, §230 (badged
//! endpoint capabilities)), and the spawner that minted it registers what it means. A writer holds
//! a badged copy, so it can neither send as badge 0 (the spawner's control channel) nor as anybody
//! else.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Badges are 32 bits here, and the kernel's are 64.** The control words pack a badge into the
//!   low half of one word beside an opcode and a field. A spawner minting past `u32::MAX` would
//!   have its registration refused rather than truncated ([`control::badge_fits`]). No spawner in
//!   the tree comes near it; recorded because the narrowing is a choice, not a fact of the kernel.
//! - **A name is at most [`control::NAME_MAX`] bytes.** Longer program names are cut at the
//!   registration, so a JSONL reader sees the prefix. Every program in the archive fits today.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 613's lane, 2026-10-02 UTC), on the `_protocol` suffix ruled at
//! milestone 265 (`_proto` is a truncation) for a crate that is a wire contract.
