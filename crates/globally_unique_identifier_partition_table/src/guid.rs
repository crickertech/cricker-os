//! GPT's GUIDs: how the GUID Partition Table stores a UUID on disk, and the partition types worth
//! recognizing by name.
//!
//! The identifier itself is [`Uuid`], from `crates/universally_unique_identifier`, in RFC 9562's
//! byte order. This module keeps only what is GPT's: the on-disk byte layout and the type constants.
//! It keeps the spec's word, GUID, because the UEFI fields it serves are spelled that way
//! (`PartitionTypeGUID`, `UniquePartitionGUID`, `DiskGUID`). Everything else says UUID, RFC 9562's
//! term (calef approved the split on 2026-10-06 (UTC)).
//!
//! # The mixed-endian trap
//!
//! A GUID is 16 bytes and everybody writes it as `C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B`. The trap is
//! that **the five groups are not stored the same way on a GPT**. The first three are integers and
//! go on disk little-endian; the last two are byte strings and go on disk in the order written. So
//! the bytes of that GUID on disk are:
//!
//! ```text
//!   28 73 2A C1  1F F8  D2 11  BA 4B  00 A0 C9 3E C9 3B
//!   \--------/   \---/  \---/  \---/  \-----------------/
//!    u32 LE       u16 LE u16 LE  as written
//! ```
//!
//! where RFC 9562 order (what [`Uuid::to_bytes`] returns) is `C1 2A 73 28 F8 1F 11 D2 BA 4B ...`.
//! This is Microsoft's `GUID` struct, which UEFI inherited; RFC 9562 section 4 names it as the one known
//! exception to big-endian storage. Getting it wrong gives you a GUID that looks plausible, matches
//! nothing, and is byte-reversed in three places out of five. [`from_disk`] and [`to_disk`] are the
//! only two functions that see the on-disk order, and [`Entry`](crate::Entry) and
//! [`Header`](crate::Header) call nothing else, so a [`Uuid`] in this crate is always canonical and
//! always prints right.
//!
//! # Type GUIDs versus unique GUIDs
//!
//! Every entry carries two. The **type** GUID says what the partition is for and is a shared
//! constant ([`types`]); the **unique** GUID names this particular partition and is generated once,
//! never reused. Confusing them is how you get two partitions the OS thinks are the same one.
