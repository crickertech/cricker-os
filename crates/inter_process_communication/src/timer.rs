//! **The timer's decision core** (milestone 106 (a wait that ends on either the interrupt or the
//! deadline), DECISIONS §147 (a timer a userspace service cannot hold)): one armed deadline per
//! timer, the cached earliest deadline the tick compares against, and the expiry walk.
//!
//! §147 ruled that the kernel owns the comparator on every architecture and signals a notification
//! at the deadline on the holder's behalf: `Timer::ARM(deadline, notification)`. What that needs
//! from the scheduler is small, and `notes/timed-wait.md` priced it before anything was built: a
//! deadline word per timer, **one cached `earliest`**, and a walk that runs only when the tick finds
//! `now >= earliest`. This module is those three things, with no kernel in them, so the arithmetic
//! can be proved on the host.
//!
//! It lives beside the notification because it is a signal source for one, and its proofs have the
//! same shape (a small symbolic state, one operation, an assertion), so they share this crate's row
//! in `script/verify`. The module name is **provisional**.
//!
//! **The load-bearing invariant is on the cache, not on a timer:** the cached earliest is never
//! later than any armed deadline. It may be *earlier* (a cancel does not raise it, because raising
//! it would mean a walk), and that costs one wasted walk at most. Later would be a missed expiry
//! that nothing ever notices, which is the one bug this structure can have.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use inter_process_communication::timer::{Arm, Timer, earliest, lowered, next_due, NEVER};
//!
//! // Two timers, each signalling a different (notification, bits) target.
//! let mut a: Timer<(u64, u64)> = Timer::new();
//! let mut b: Timer<(u64, u64)> = Timer::new();
//! let mut cached = NEVER;
//!
//! // Arm both at time 100. A deadline in the future is pending; the cache moves down to meet it.
//! assert_eq!(a.arm(150, (7, 0b01), 100), Arm::Pending);
//! cached = lowered(cached, 150);
//! assert_eq!(b.arm(120, (7, 0b10), 100), Arm::Pending);
//! cached = lowered(cached, 120);
//! assert_eq!(cached, 120);
//!
//! // A deadline already passed fires at once instead of waiting for a tick.
//! let mut c: Timer<(u64, u64)> = Timer::new();
//! assert_eq!(c.arm(90, (8, 1), 100), Arm::DueNow((8, 1)));
//! assert!(!c.is_armed());
//!
//! // The tick at 130 is due (130 >= 120). The walk fires b and only b, then recomputes the cache.
//! let mut fired = Vec::new();
//! while let Some(t) = next_due([&mut a, &mut b].into_iter(), 130) {
//!     fired.push(t);
//! }
//! assert_eq!(fired, vec![(7, 0b10)]);
//! cached = earliest([&a, &b].into_iter());
//! assert_eq!(cached, 150);
//!
//! // Re-arming replaces the old deadline: the old one can never fire.
//! a.arm(500, (7, 0b01), 130);
//! assert_eq!(a.expire(150), None);
//! // And a cancel reports whether it stopped anything.
//! assert!(a.cancel());
//! assert!(!a.cancel());
//! ```
