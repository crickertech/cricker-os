//! **The argument page** (milestone 205 (how a foreign program is told what to do), DECISIONS
//! §170 (how a foreign program is told what to do)). One definition of the read-only page that carries a `std` program's argv, so whoever
//! assembles it (the shell, and the kernel test harness) and whoever reads it (the `std` PAL's
//! `sys/args`) cannot drift. The same split `environment_protocol` makes for the configuration page.
//!
//! Name: provisional, like the layout below. Both are a wire format two programs agree on, so a
//! ruling fixes them; `design/roadmap/proposals/the-argument-page-layout.md` is the proposal.
//!
//! # What §170 ruled, and what this page therefore is not
//!
//! **A program written by somebody else hears its arguments as bytes, and the bytes carry no
//! authority.** `rg foo src` gives `ripgrep` the three byte strings `rg`, `foo` and `src`. Whether
//! `ripgrep` may read `src` is decided somewhere else entirely: by the directory the line granted
//! and by what the program's manifest says a resolved word may be. So nothing on this page is
//! validated for meaning, unlike `environment_protocol`'s, and nothing needs to be: a pattern is
//! arbitrary bytes, and a path that names something the program was not granted reaches nothing.
//!
//! # The layout
//!
//! ```text
//!   offset  size  field
//!   0       8     MAGIC, b"nifeargv"
//!   8       4     count, little-endian u32: how many arguments
//!   12      4     total, little-endian u32: how many bytes of records follow
//!   16      ...   count records, each a little-endian u32 length and then that many bytes
//! ```
//!
//! - **Length-prefixed, not NUL-terminated**, so an argument may hold any byte, including NUL and
//!   the `0xff` a regex can carry. `args_os` is `OsString`, and a path need not be text.
//! - **`argv[0]` is present.** `ripgrep` skips the first element and `clap` treats it as the
//!   binary's name, so a block without it would lose the pattern. [`PageBuilder`] does not insist,
//!   because an empty argv is a representable thing to hand a program; the shell always pushes the
//!   name it ran.
//! - **Everything past the records is unspecified.** A reader never looks there, so a page reused
//!   for a shorter line needs no clearing.
//! - **One page.** [`CAPACITY`] is 4,080 bytes of records, the four-byte prefixes included.
//!   A line that does not fit is refused at assembly ([`Refused::TooLong`]), never truncated.
//!
//! # A page that does not parse reads as no arguments
//!
//! [`MAGIC`] is checked first, and then every length against what is left, the same
//! default-honest shape `environment_protocol::ConfigPage` uses. A zeroed frame, a page belonging
//! to something else, or a count that disagrees with the records all answer an empty argv rather
//! than a partial one: a program that sees half its arguments would act on a line nobody typed.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use argument_protocol::{ArgPage, PAGE_BYTES, PageBuilder};
//!
//! let mut page = [0u8; PAGE_BYTES];
//! let mut b = PageBuilder::new(&mut page);
//! for a in [&b"rg"[..], b"ab\xffcd", b"src"] {
//!     b.push(a).unwrap();
//! }
//! b.finish();
//! let args: Vec<&[u8]> = ArgPage::parse(&page).iter().collect();
//! assert_eq!(args, [&b"rg"[..], b"ab\xffcd", b"src"]);
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A secret on a command line is plain bytes on this page**, handed to the program with no
//!   protection. §170 records it as the ruling's known cost; §111 (inert configuration is a read-only page) refused free-form strings on the
//!   configuration page for exactly this reason, and no layout can help, because a regex is
//!   arbitrary bytes too.
//! - **The environment does not ride here.** §170 is silent on environment variables for a foreign
//!   program, so they stay on §111's validated page and this one carries argv alone.
