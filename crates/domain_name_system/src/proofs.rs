//! Machine-checked proofs (Kani), run by `script/verify`. The property worth solver time here is
//! the one a fuzzer can only sample: a name server, or anyone who can forge its replies, feeds the
//! name decoder, and it must terminate and stay in bounds on **every** byte string. The compression
//! pointer loop is the classic DNS parser hang, and the decoder's strictly-backwards fence turns it
//! into an error; the first harness quantifies that over every message of the proved size.
//!
//! The bounds are small, the trade `globally_unique_identifier_partition_table`'s CRC harnesses
//! record: what is proved is structure (termination, bounds, round trips), which grows no new
//! behaviour with length, and realistic lengths are covered by the tests and the fuzz target. The
//! first two harnesses are the retired `multicast_dns_protocol`'s, whose measurements chose these
//! bounds: deciding the decoder against its full 255-byte output ran past twenty solver minutes, and
//! against a 32-byte one it is seconds, with the loop identical.
