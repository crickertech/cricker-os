//! **The DNS wire format a stub resolver needs** (RFC 1035; RFC 7766 for TCP), as pure computation.
//!
//! Milestone 384 (in a capability system the resolver is a grant) starts from a measured gap: nothing in this
//! tree turns a host name into an address, so a program cannot reach a host by name however good
//! its HTTP and TLS are. This crate is the part of the answer that is not a design fork: the bytes of
//! a query for one name's IPv4 addresses, and the checks a reply must pass before any address in it
//! is believed. It owns no socket, no timer and no policy. Which program sends these bytes, and the
//! capability that says which names a client may ask it about, are the milestone's open questions,
//! and `notes/name-resolution.md` carries them as a proposal rather than as code.
//!
//! Every byte this crate parses arrived from the network, from a server the client may not trust,
//! through a path the client cannot see. So the parser is written to be total (no input panics or
//! hangs it, which Kani checks for the name decoder and `fuzz/fuzz_targets/domain_name_system_reply.rs`
//! exercises for the rest), and [`Query::accept`] is written to believe as little as it can.
//!
//! # What a reply must pass, in order
//!
//! [`Query::accept`] is the whole of a stub resolver's defence against a forged or confused answer,
//! the same role `network_time_protocol::Query::accept` plays for time:
//!
//! 1. It parses as a DNS message at all ([`Reject::Malformed`]).
//! 2. It is a response, to a standard query ([`Reject::NotAResponse`]).
//! 3. It carries the transaction id we sent ([`Reject::IdMismatch`]). Over UDP that id is the
//!    sixteen bits an off-path forger must guess, so the caller draws it from the entropy service.
//! 4. It is not truncated ([`Reject::Truncated`], which over UDP means "ask again over TCP").
//! 5. It echoes exactly our question: one question, our name (compared without regard to ASCII
//!    case), type A, class IN ([`Reject::QuestionMismatch`]).
//! 6. Its response code is success ([`Reject::NoSuchName`] for NXDOMAIN, [`Reject::ServerError`]
//!    for the rest).
//! 7. Its answer section follows a chain of CNAMEs **from our name**, at most [`MAX_CHAIN`] links,
//!    and the addresses taken are the A records owned by the end of that chain and nothing else
//!    ([`Reject::ChainTooLong`], [`Reject::NoAddress`]). A record for any other owner is ignored,
//!    which is what keeps a reply about `example.com` from planting an address for `bank.test`.
//!    The authority and additional sections are never read at all.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A query, a reply as a recursive server would send it (the answer's owner is a compression
//! pointer back to the question), and the address that comes out:
//!
//! ```
//! use domain_name_system::{Query, Reject};
//!
//! let query = Query::new(0x4e1f, "packages.nife.test").unwrap();
//! let mut request = [0u8; 512];
//! let n = query.request(&mut request).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(&request[..2], &[0x4e, 0x1f]); // our transaction id
//!
//! // The reply: our header with QR and RA set, our question back, then one A record.
//! let mut reply = request[..n].to_vec();
//! reply[2] |= 0x80; // QR: a response
//! reply[3] |= 0x80; // RA
//! reply[7] = 1; // ANCOUNT = 1
//! reply.extend_from_slice(&[0xc0, 0x0c]); // owner: a pointer to the question's name
//! reply.extend_from_slice(&[0, 1, 0, 1]); // type A, class IN
//! reply.extend_from_slice(&300u32.to_be_bytes()); // TTL
//! reply.extend_from_slice(&[0, 4, 10, 0, 2, 9]); // RDLENGTH 4, then the address
//!
//! let answer = query.accept(&reply).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(answer.addresses(), &[[10, 0, 2, 9]]);
//! assert_eq!(answer.ttl(), 300);
//!
//! // The same bytes under somebody else's transaction id are not an answer to us.
//! reply[1] ^= 1;
//! assert_eq!(query.accept(&reply), Err(Reject::IdMismatch));
//! ```
//!
//! Over TCP the same message carries a two-byte length in front, and the reply may arrive in pieces:
//!
//! ```
//! use domain_name_system::{Query, TcpReply};
//!
//! let query = Query::new(7, "nife.test").unwrap();
//! let mut out = [0u8; 514];
//! let n = query.request_tcp(&mut out).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(u16::from_be_bytes([out[0], out[1]]) as usize, n - 2);
//!
//! let mut buf = [0u8; 600];
//! let mut reply = TcpReply::new(&mut buf);
//! assert_eq!(reply.feed(&[0, 3, 1]), Ok(false)); // a length, and one byte of three
//! assert_eq!(reply.feed(&[2, 3]), Ok(true));
//! assert_eq!(reply.message(), Some(&[1u8, 2, 3][..]));
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **IPv4 only.** It asks for A records and never AAAA, because `net_stack` builds `smoltcp` with
//!   `proto-ipv4` alone and an IPv6 address would have nowhere to go.
//! - **No EDNS(0)**, so a UDP reply is at most 512 bytes ([`UDP_MESSAGE_MAX`]) and a larger answer
//!   comes back truncated, which the caller answers by asking again over TCP. That is RFC 1035's
//!   behaviour and it costs a second exchange for large answers.
//! - **No DNSSEC.** An on-path attacker who can read the query can forge the reply, transaction id
//!   and all, exactly as against plain NTP. What this crate removes is the off-path forger who cannot
//!   see the id, and only as well as the caller's id is unguessable. It does not randomise the case
//!   of the question (the "0x20" trick), which would add up to one bit per letter.
//! - **At most [`MAX_ADDRESSES`] addresses** are kept from one answer; the rest are dropped without
//!   comment, which a resolver that only needs one address to connect to will not notice.
//! - **Host names are restricted** to letters, digits, `-` and `_` in each label ([`Name::from_dotted`]).
//!   The wire format allows any byte; a host name a person types does not need them, and refusing
//!   them keeps escape syntax out of the one place a client's text becomes wire bytes.
//!
//! Name: provisional 2026-10-04 (milestone 384's lane, an agent). DNS spelled out under §154 (the
//! acronym test is whether the phrase is spoken, applied recursively), since people do say "the
//! domain name system", the way `network_time_protocol` spells out NTP. Refused `dns` for that
//! reason, and `name_resolver`, which names the program milestone 384 leaves open rather than the
//! wire format this crate is.
