//! **What the confined syscall fuzzer and its conductor agree on** (milestone 779 (fuzz the surface
//! a confined process can reach), provisional).
//!
//! `fixtures/src/confined_syscall_fuzzer.rs` is an EL0 program that issues random syscalls from
//! inside a confined process. `system_tests/src/user/confined_fuzzer_tests.rs` spawns it, lets it
//! take one call at a time, and after each call checks that it reached nothing it was not granted.
//! Both binaries need the same slot layout, the same two conductor words and the same report-page
//! layout, so those live here (AGENTS.md rule 7: anything two binaries agree on is a crate).
//!
//! Every name in this crate is provisional, the crate's included.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 779's lane, 2026-10-06 UTC).

/// Slot 0, not the last slot as the scaffolding first had it: `user::run` grants a `Spawn`'s
/// capabilities into slots 0, 1, 2, ... in order and offers no way to place one at a chosen slot,
/// and the witness holds only this capability, so the slot it lands in by grant must be the slot
