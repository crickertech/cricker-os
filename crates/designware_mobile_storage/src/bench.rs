//! **The bench step's two halves, as logic**: the read-only probe and the scratch write test.
//!
//! These are the sequences `kernel/src/storage_bench.rs` runs on radon. They live here so the
//! order of operations, which is the safety argument, is tested on a host rather than first tried
//! on the card radon boots from:
//!
//! - [`read_only`] identifies the card, reads sector 0, parses the MBR, reads the first
//!   partition's boot sector, and times a sequential read from the start of that partition. It
//!   sends no command that writes.
//! - [`scratch_write`] writes only inside [`Mbr::scratch`]'s range, the gap before the first
//!   partition, and only after reading what is there; it writes a pattern, reads it back, writes
//!   the original back and reads that back too. A card it cannot find a gap on is refused, not
//!   written.
