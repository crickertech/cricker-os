//! **The controller's register map**, adapted from OpenBSD's `sys/dev/fdt/dwmmc.c` (the crate root
//! carries its notice) and cross-checked against `dwmmc-host` 0.4.2's `regs.rs` (Apache-2.0), which

//! Only the first page matters to this driver: every register it touches, and the data FIFO, sit
