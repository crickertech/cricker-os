//! **Commands, and the `CMD` register word that sends each one.**
//!
//! The flag choices are OpenBSD's `dwmmc_exec_command`, adapted: the hold register on every command,
//! wait-for-previous-data on everything but CMD12 and CMD13, the initialization clocks on CMD0, and
//! an automatic CMD12 after a multi-block transfer. The response kinds are the SD Physical Layer
//! Simplified Specification's (section 4.9) and JEDEC JESD84's for eMMC; which of them carry a
//! CRC is the spec's statement, and the R3 exception (the OCR register has no CRC, its CRC field
//! reads as all ones) is why [`Response::checks_crc`] exists.
