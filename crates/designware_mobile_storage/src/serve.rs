//! **What the kernel and the EL0 block server agree on**: where the server's two windows sit, the
//! part of the card it may serve, and the three spawn words that say so.
//!
//! The server (`components/src/designware_mobile_storage.rs`) answers `filesystem_protocol::blk`,
//! the four verbs the virtio and NVMe block servers answer, so the FS server cannot tell which
//! disk it has. Its blocks are 4096 bytes; the card's are 512. A request names blocks **inside a
//! window** the kernel chose at spawn, never a card address, and [`Window::translate`] is the one
//! place a block becomes a sector: a Kani harness proves no request reaches outside the window.
//!
//! Which window radon's filesystem gets is not this module's decision. See the crate root's BUGS
//! and the 53 block: it is a fact two programs (whatever writes the card and the kernel that reads
//! it) must agree on, which makes it an architect's call.
