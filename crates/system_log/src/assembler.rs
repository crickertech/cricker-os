//! **One writer's chunks into lines.** A byte-sink writer sends at most sixteen bytes a message,
//! and two writers' messages arrive interleaved in whatever order the scheduler ran them. Keeping a
//! partial line per badge is what turns that into whole lines per writer, which is the property the
//! console needs from this service. Milestone 342 (the kernel and the `console` server drive one
//! UART from two address spaces) rests on it: the splice cannot happen with the drainer alive.
