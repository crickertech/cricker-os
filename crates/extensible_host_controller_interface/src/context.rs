//! **Slot and endpoint contexts** (xHCI 1.2 section 6.2): what the driver tells the controller about a
//! device and its endpoints.
//!
//! A *device context* is an array of contexts the controller owns once a device is addressed: the
//! slot context, then one endpoint context per *device context index* (DCI; endpoint 0 is DCI 1,
//! endpoint `n` OUT is `2n`, IN is `2n + 1`). An *input context* is what the driver hands a
//! command: an input control context saying which contexts to add or drop, then a slot context
//! and endpoint contexts in the same order, one index along. A context is 32 or 64 bytes depending
//! on the controller (`HCCPARAMS1.CSZ`); only the first 32 carry fields.
