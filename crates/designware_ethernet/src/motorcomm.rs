//! **The Motorcomm YT8531, the PHY on both of radon's ports**, configured for the board it is on.
//!
//! The sequence is OpenBSD's `ytphy_yt8521_init`, `ytphy_yt8531_init` and `ytphy_yt8521_update`
//! (`sys/dev/mii/ytphy.c`, revision 1.6 of 2024-03-12, commit `9d7a05f92003`, ISC license, notice in
//! the crate root): the RGMII delays, the receive pad drive strengths, the clock output, and the
//! transmit clock inversion chosen per negotiated speed. Two registers OpenBSD does not touch come
//! from Linux's `drivers/net/phy/motorcomm.c`, read as facts about the part and not as code
//! ([`EXT_SLEEP_CONTROL1`], [`EXT_CLOCK_GATING`]); why this driver writes them is at each.
//!
//! # Two spellings of the same settings, and they agree
//!
//! radon's firmware hands over **the vendor U-Boot's** tree, which states the PHY's register
//! values directly; mainline Linux states the physical quantities they encode. For radon's
//! `gmac0` (VisionFive 2 v1.3B):
//!
//! | quantity | vendor U-Boot (`starfive_visionfive2.dts`) | mainline Linux (`...-v1.3b.dts`) | register value |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | receive clock delay | `rx_delay_sel = <0xa>`, `rxc_dly_en = <0>` | `rx-internal-delay-ps = <1500>` | `0xa`, delay-enable clear |
//! | transmit clock delay | `tx_delay_sel = <0xa>` | `tx-internal-delay-ps = <1500>` | `0xa` |
//! | receive clock drive | `rgmii_sw_dr_rxc = <0x6>` | `motorcomm,rx-clk-drv-microamp = <3970>` | `6` at 1.8 V |
//! | receive data drive | `rgmii_sw_dr = <0x3>` | `motorcomm,rx-data-drv-microamp = <2910>` | `3` at 1.8 V |
//! | transmit clock inverted at 1000 | `tx_inverted_1000 = <0x1>` | `motorcomm,tx-clk-1000-inverted` | set |
//!
//! [`Settings::FALLBACK_GMAC0`] is that column, used only when a tree states neither spelling, and
//! [`Settings::source`] says which happened.
