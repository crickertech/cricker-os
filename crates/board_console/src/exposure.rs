//! **A soak capture, read into the exposure row the defect-discovery curve wants.**
//!
//! Built for milestone 225 (run the soak on radon, argon and xenon), whose rows feed milestone 201
//! (is multicore reliability converging).
//!
//! `notes/multicore-defect-curve.md` keeps two tables, and the one that matters most is the one
//! most likely to go unwritten: an *exposure* row for every boot that ran the soak, clean or not.
//! Until this module that row was made by hand from the last heartbeat, and the three radon rows
//! made that way before 2026-09-25 lost their build, their final beat and their logs. The fourth
//! (E4) was right because a careful person made it. This makes the fifth the same way every time.
//!
//! It reads a finished capture (a `script/board-console` log, or a `script/soak-test` one from
//! QEMU, which the curve does not accept but which proves the reader) and returns one [`Boot`] per
//! kernel banner. A boot that never printed `soak-test: started` is kept, because "the board came
//! up and the workload did not" is a finding, but it produces no row.
//!
//! # What it reads, and what it cannot
//!
//! From the log alone: the architecture and the tick rate (the `nife machine:` line), the cores
//! online (`smp: N core(s) online`, falling back to the machine line's processor count), and every
//! heartbeat. From those, every column of the row except three, which no console line carries:
//!
//! - **machine**: the board's name. `nife machine: aarch64` is argon, an Apple Silicon Mac under
//!   HVF, or QEMU, and the log cannot tell them apart.
//! - **build**: the kernel does not print its commit. E4's row has one only because the bench
//!   lane wrote it down.
//! - **start**: the capture has no wall clock. The heartbeat's `t=` is the kernel's own.
//!
//! The caller passes those three, and anything not passed prints as `?` rather than as a guess.
//!
//! # The two checks to make before walking away
//!
//! Both come from milestone 221 (the soak never crosses cores, so build the hook that makes it).
//!
//! [`Boot::checks`] repeats them after the fact, so a run that was never checked at the bench is
//! still classified correctly. `crossings` must rise between the first and last beat (frozen is a
//! soak that never crossed cores, which the curve excludes), and `wakerate` must be near
//! `TICK_HZ * cores` (well under it is the timer or the wake path falling behind).
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The id is `E?`.** Ids are never reused and are assigned in the note, where the next free
//!   one is visible. A reader that guessed would collide with a row another bench session added.
//! - **"Rising" is judged on the first and last beats only.** A soak that crossed for a minute and
//!   then froze for seven hours would pass. The per-beat series is in the log; reading the slope
//!   would be a stronger claim than this check makes, and nothing has yet produced that shape.
//! - **The wakerate threshold is 80% of `TICK_HZ * cores`**, which is a judgement, not a
//!   measurement. radon's eight-hour run sat at 101% of it; a slow board that reads 75% is a
//!   question to ask, and this prints it as one rather than failing the row.
//! - **A boot is split at the banner (`nife on `)**, so a capture that lost the banner to line
//!   noise merges two boots into one. The rebooting soak would show it as one long boot with two
//!   `soak-test: started` lines; the count is printed so that is visible.
//!
//! # Examples
