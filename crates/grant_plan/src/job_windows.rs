//! **The file service's client windows, as the progenitor hands them to jobs** (milestone 599 (a
//! frame per filesystem client channel), milestone 685 (a job is finished when its memory is
//! back)).
//!
//! The progenitor gives every directory-granted job a window of its own: a page of the file
//! service's pool and the service's endpoint badged with the window's number. A window shared by
//! two live jobs is the shared-channel race the pool exists to close, and worse once the window is
//! bound (confinement claim 24 in `notes/confinement-claims.md`): the older job's badge resolves to
//! the newer job's directory. So a window must not go to a new job while its last holder lives.
//!
//! This is the pool's bookkeeping alone, pure logic so the rule is tested on the host. The
//! progenitor (`crates/system_initializer`) owns the capabilities and the binding.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 685's lane).
//!
//! The rule, since milestone 685: [`Windows::take`] hands a window only to a job when the job that
//! last held it has been reaped, which the progenitor learns from `job_undertaker`'s "reaped"
//! message (`crate::spawnproto::UNDERTAKER_BADGE`). Calef's ruling of 2026-10-06 (UTC), option A of
//! `design/roadmap/685-a-job-is-finished-when-its-memory-is-back.md`.
//!
//! [`ReapsDue`] is the other half of that message's use: which finished jobs the progenitor may
//! wait for, when a pool is short, because their reap is on its way.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A window is only as free as the reaps that reach the progenitor.** A job that is never
//!   reaped by `job_undertaker` keeps its window for the life of the boot. A screen-narrowed job
//!   (DECISIONS §106 (the `terminal_sink_caretaker` narrowing)) is reaped by the shell, not the
//!   undertaker, so one behind a directory grant would; no manifest in the tree is both today
//!   (`mdr`, the one program that writes while it reads, forbids a directory). Leaking is the safe
//!   direction: the pool refuses spawns, it never shares a window.
