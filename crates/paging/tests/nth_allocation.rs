//! **A page-table allocator that fails on its Nth call**, swept over N until the mapping succeeds.
//!
//! Every `OutOfPageFrames` return in `Mapper` is an error path that fires midway through a mapping,
//! after something was taken: tables allocated for the levels above, or (for `map_span`,
//! `map_range` and `build_identity_domain`) whole leaves mapped before the one that failed. No test
//! reached any of them before this file (`notes/untested-error-paths.md` ranked twelve such paths in
//! this crate). The proposal this builds is *a page-table allocator that fails on its Nth call*, in
//! `design/roadmap/proposals/`.
//!
//! The allocator below fails on exactly one call, counted from 0, and succeeds on every other. One
//! failure rather than exhaustion is the stricter model: a mapper that swallowed the error and
//! carried on would succeed on the next call and leave a hole, which exhaustion would hide by
//! failing that call too.
//!
//! After every failure, three things are asserted, and they are the whole claim:
//!
//! 1. **No table frame is leaked.** The tables reachable from the root are exactly the root plus
//!    every frame the allocator handed out. A frame handed out and not reachable is one nobody can
//!    free, because the mapper does not own frames and teardown frees what the tables reach.
//! 2. **What is left mapped is a prefix**, in the caller's order, of what the successful run maps:
//!    nothing for `map_block`, the leaves before the failing one for the rest. That prefix is what
//!    the kernel's `unmap_run_prefix` is given to unwind. A leaf past a gap is a half-installed
//!    request nobody records.
//! 3. **The error is `OutOfPageFrames`**, the one the kernel turns into `OutOfMemory`.
//!
//! What the sweep measured on the tree it landed on is in the roadmap block that built it: no leak
//! and no hole on any function, any format, any N. It does leave empty intermediate tables standing
//! after a failure, which is reachable and so not a leak by (1); see `map`'s and `unmap`'s docs for
//! why tables are never torn down piecemeal.
//!
//! Names in this file (the file, the helpers, the tests) are provisional.
