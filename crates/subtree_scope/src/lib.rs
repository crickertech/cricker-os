//! **What a subtree grant can reach, decided in one place a server links and a prover checks**
//! (milestone 606 (a directory walk costs what it does on Linux), calef's ruling D, 2026-09-27).
//!
//! A subtree grant used to be enforced by a process: `fs_subtree_caretaker` sat between the client
//! and the filesystem server, held the only endpoint that named the server, and kept the client's
//! handles in a table of its own. Ruling D lets an eligible server do that itself, keyed on the
//! badge milestone 599 (a frame per filesystem client channel) put on `RECEIVE_CAP`, and saves the
//! caretaker's round trip. The ruling's terms are what this crate is for:
//!
//! - **One shared crate.** Every eligible server resolves every path through [`walk`] and every
//!   handle through [`admit`], so there is one implementation of confinement to read and prove,
//!   not one per filesystem.
//! - **Proven with Kani.** The harnesses at the bottom state the properties as properties: a step
//!   is one name, a walk never widens, a walk never follows a symbolic link or crosses a mount, and
//!   a bound badge reaches its own root and the handles it minted and nothing else, ever again.
//! - **It owns the hard cases.** `..`, symbolic links, hard links and mount crossings are decided
//!   here and not in the server:
//!   - `..` and `.` are never names ([`is_name`]), so a path can only go down.
//!   - A symbolic link is never followed, on the way or at the end ([`Kind::Symlink`]). A server
//!     that wants links followed inside a grant is asking for a policy this crate does not have.
//!   - A mount point is never crossed ([`Kind::MountPoint`]). A grant is one filesystem.
//!   - A hard link is a second name for a file, and a file reached by a name inside the grant is
//!     inside the grant. That is the Unix rule and it is the right one for a subtree grant, whose
//!     authority is over names. A directory has no hard links in any filesystem that is eligible.
//!
//! Caretakers stay the default. A server is eligible only when it is memory-safe and routes every
//! path and every handle through here, and the progenitor chooses per mount from what the
//! filesystem's package declares.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A badge is a window and a grant at once.** Under §230 (badged endpoint capabilities) a badge
//!   is the index of the client's staging window, and this crate binds a grant to that same index.
//!   A revoked badge must not be handed to a new client while its old holder is alive, or the old
//!   holder reaches the new grant. The progenitor's window pool releases a window at reap, which
//!   is after the holder is dead; nothing here can check that.
//! - **The proof is bounded.** Paths are proved up to [`PROOF_PATH`] bytes and binding tables of
//!   [`PROOF_BADGES`] badges over [`PROOF_OPERATIONS`] operations. The functions have no loops whose
//!   behaviour changes past those bounds, which is the argument that the bound is enough; it is an
//!   argument, not a proof.
//!
//! Name: provisional 2026-09-27 (milestone 606's lane, ruling D). calef names crates.
