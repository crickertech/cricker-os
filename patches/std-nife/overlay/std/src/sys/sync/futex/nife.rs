//! **The futex `std`'s locks are built on, on nife** (milestone 812 (`std::thread::spawn` runs real
//! threads in one address space); §269 (how threads share a process) fork 2): `AddressSpace::WAIT`
//! and `WAKE` on this program's own space, whose capability is `runtimeproto::SPACE_SLOT`. The
//! private 32-bit form, the one the kernel admits. `notes/futex.md` has the contract.
//!
//! **Without the space capability, or with a timeout, a wait yields instead of sleeping.** A
//! futex wait may return spuriously and every caller re-checks its word, so a yield that returns
//! is correct, only slower. That keeps every lock correct in a program given no space capability,
//! which every program built before 812 is.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A timed wait spins on `yield` until its deadline** (`notes/futex.md`: the kernel's `WAIT`
//!   has no timeout yet). `Condvar::wait_timeout`, `park_timeout` and timed lock attempts are
//!   correct and burn a core while they wait.
