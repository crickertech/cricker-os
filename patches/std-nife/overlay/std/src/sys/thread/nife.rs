//! **`std::thread` on nife: real threads in one address space** (milestone 812
//! (`std::thread::spawn` runs real threads in one address space); §269 (how threads share a
//! process), as calef ruled it on pull request #1892).
//!
//! A spawned thread is a TCB retyped from the heap's region, joined to this program's own process
//! through `ThreadControlBlock::CONFIGURE` with the process capability in
//! `runtimeproto::PROCESS_SLOT` (which carries `BIND`). It runs on a stack from the heap, shares the
//! capability table, the space and every lock, and has its own thread pointer, set at `CONFIGURE`,
//! naming its own block (`sys::thread_local::key::nife`). It ends with `SYS_EXIT_THREAD`, which
//! clears the word its joiner waits on only once it has left its stack for good.
//!
//! A program given no process capability cannot spawn: `Thread::new` answers `Unsupported`, which
//! is what every nife program answered before 812.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A spawned thread's stack has no guard page.** It is heap memory, so an overflow writes into
//!   the heap rather than faulting. `notes/std/threads.md` has the plan.
//! - **A detached thread's stack is never freed**: nothing is left to free it once the thread has
//!   gone, so a program that spawns and drops threads without joining leaks one stack each.
//! - **Each spawn spends one TCB page of the heap's region for good** (`notes/processes.md`).
//! - **A process has at most `current_cpu_protocol::THREAD_PAGE_SLOTS` (16) threads**, its main
//!   thread included; one more spawn answers `OutOfMemory` as an `io::Error`.
