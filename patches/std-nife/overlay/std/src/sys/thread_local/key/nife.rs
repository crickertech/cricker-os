//! **Thread-local keys on nife, through the thread pointer** (milestone 812 (`std::thread::spawn`
//! runs real threads in one address space); §269 (how threads share a process) fork 4).
//!
//! Each thread's thread pointer (`TPIDR_EL0`, `tp`, the `FS` base) names its own [`Block`]: the
//! kernel sets it, at `CONFIGURE` for a spawned thread and through `SET_THREAD_POINTER` on its own
//! TCB for the main thread, and keeps it per thread. A `thread_local!` is a key, an index into the
//! block's slots, which is xous's shape for the same register. The block also carries what a
//! thread needs to know about itself: its current-CPU page (§269 fork 6, whose address `CONFIGURE`
//! answered) and its sleep objects.
//!
//! **The main thread's block is made on first use**, before any second thread can exist, because
//! `Thread::new` makes it first. Until then the main thread is the only thread, so a process-wide
//! flag says "not yet" without a race. On `x86_64` that matters for more than speed: ring 3 cannot
//! read the `FS` base (`CR4.FSGSBASE` is off), only address through it, so a block's first word
//! points at the block itself and is read as `fs:[0]`, which before the base is set would read
//! address zero.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **[`KEYS`] keys a process**, and a key is never reused: `std` makes one per `thread_local!`
//!   that is ever touched. More aborts the program, as xous's does.
