//! **The install gate**: a stick boots, puts itself on a disk, and the machine boots from that disk
//! with the stick gone (milestone 198 (a package manager, and the trivial install that makes a
//! second customer possible), rung 2a.
//!
//! Milestone 515 (a stick that puts itself on the machine's disk) is the proposal it follows.
//!
//! # Why it is two boots, and then a third
//!
//! **A sequence that only works while the stick is still attached has not installed anything.** The
//! second boot is therefore the whole gate: the first one is a setup step for it, and everything the
//! first one asserts is only there so a failure says which half broke.
//!
//! Three properties are deliberately arranged so that the second boot cannot succeed by accident:
//!
//! - **The stick is not attached at all**, not merely deprioritised. `NIFE_UEFI_NO_STICK=1` removes
//!   the vvfat drive from the machine.
//! - **The firmware variable store is deleted before each boot.** The default store persists across
//!   runs in a checkout, so boot 1 would leave a boot option that boot 2 then rode. Deleting it is
//!   what makes "the firmware found it on its own" a claim about the disk rather than about our
//!   leftovers, and it is the measurement milestone 515 calls B1 and calls unmeasured.
//! - **The NVMe image is created empty**, every run, so nothing survives from the last one.
//!
//! The third boot is the stick again, on the machine it installed, with nobody typing anything
//! ([`stick_on_the_installed_machine`]). It is the live stick proposal's G1 and G2 as a measurement:
//! which system ran, and whether the disk changed by a single byte.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```console
//! $ cargo xtask install-boot
//! --- the stick installs itself onto an empty NVMe disk ---
//!   install     : installed. nife data at LBA 2048, EFI system at LBA 1046528.
//! --- boot 2 of 3: the same machine with the stick detached ---
//! BdsDxe: loading Boot0001 "UEFI QEMU NVMe Ctrl nife-nvme 1" ...
//! $ ls
//!   made-on-target
//! --- boot 3 of 3: the stick again, with the installed disk attached ---
//! uefi_loader: the boot slots here are on another disk; this file's medium has none, so it is using the image in this file
//! install-boot: boot 3 left the installed disk byte-for-byte unchanged
//! install-boot: PASS
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **It is one disk of one size**, a 1 GiB image. The installer's layout arithmetic has a floor
//!   and a rounding step that nothing here varies, and a disk under about 600 MiB is refused by
//!   code no test exercises.
//! - **It proves nothing about a real firmware.** OVMF is one implementation and a generous one.
//!   Rung 2b is the bench half and belongs to somebody with xenon in front of them.
//! - **It runs nowhere on its own.** It was left out of `script/test`'s default legs because the
//!   two boots were said to take several minutes under TCG. Measured 2026-10-03 on an Apple M-series
//!   host, warm: 42.5 seconds for the whole gate. Nothing schedules it either, so a break is found
//!   by whoever next runs it by hand: `design/roadmap/712-the-install-gates-run-nowhere.md`.
//! - **Boot 3 proves the stick left the disk alone under OVMF, and only there.** What keeps it so
//!   is the `boot_slot::medium` token (calef's ruling on PR #1652, 2026-10-04 UTC): the loader
//!   writes it only when its file is on an NVMe namespace, and a real firmware that built that
//!   device path differently would leave an installed machine without its filesystem rather than
//!   a stick with one.
//! - **Boot 3 needs the disk in the firmware's boot order.** OVMF connects only the devices its boot
//!   options name, so with the stick alone the loader never sees the disk and G1 cannot happen.
//!   `NIFE_NVME_DEVICE_OPTS=,bootindex=1` is what makes it the machine a boot menu would give.
//! - **A failure leaves the NVMe image behind**, on purpose: it is the evidence, and
//!   `hdiutil attach -imagekey diskimage-class=CRawDiskImage` on the partition reads the EFI system
//!   partition it wrote.
