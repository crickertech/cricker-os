# radon, 2026-10-05 (UTC): milestones 761 and 766, then a bisect of the one-task rise

Nineteen boots of the job mix on radon, power-cycled by calef from 09:56 to 10:35 UTC. Boots 1 to 7
follow [`RUN-SHEET.md`](RUN-SHEET.md), written before any boot and committed unedited. Boots 8 to
19 were added the same evening to explain why boot 1's one-task guard failed. Read with
[`notes/job-mix/radon-2026-10-05.md`](../../notes/job-mix/radon-2026-10-05.md).

`bootN-<payload>.log` are console transcripts cleaned by the run sheet's `tr` (non-printing bytes
dropped); the raw captures are not committed. `bootN-<payload>.netboot.log` is the TFTP server's
log, which names the directory served and the bytes fetched; boots 6 and 7 share one server run.
No console line names a payload, so the netboot log and the hashes below are the record of which
image a boot ran. Every boot printed `one of 7 kinds`, `median of 21 repeats` and `job-mix: done`.

## Boot, payload, commit

`null_syscall` `per_job` in 4 MHz ticks, from `LC_ALL=C grep -a 'kind=null_syscall'`. "Merge" is
the position in the 74 first-parent merges from `b500b3d48` to `c8b5fd09e`. Every payload was built
with `script/board-image --job-mix --tftp` (riscv64, release kernel; see its `BUGS` for the
userspace profile). `nife-vf2.img` hashes are the first 12 hex digits; full hashes of both files are
in [`payloads.sha256`](payloads.sha256) (boots 1 to 7) and
[`bisect-payloads.sha256`](bisect-payloads.sha256) (boots 8 to 19).

Built and never booted: `no1663`, `c8b5fd09e` with #1663's userspace change reverted
([`no1663.patch`](no1663.patch), staged in its worktree; hashes in `bisect-payloads.sha256`).

## Things a reader of the hashes should know

- Identical source in two worktrees did not give identical archives: `main` and `unaligned` differ
  only in `kernel/src/cpu.rs` and their `nife-initrd.img` hashes differ (`4654c6a8...` and
  `c34d848d...`, same size). The hashes identify what was served; they do not prove two builds
  were the same source. The commit and patch columns do that.
- Every patch here was scratch, never committed to a branch. `oldstub.patch` declares `a5`
  clobbered so the five-register stub stays sound against the six-register kernel.
