//! IPC round-trip latency on the host OS, lmbench's `lat_pipe`, and the host side of nife's
//! EL0 `ipc_rtt_el0` bench (notes/benchmarks.md, milestone 25).
//!
//! Two **processes** (fork, so the round trip crosses an address-space boundary, exactly as ours
//! does over two EL0 processes) connected by a pair of pipes. One iteration is: parent writes a
//! byte, child reads it and writes a byte back, parent reads it, four syscalls and two context
//! switches, the same shape as our client SEND / server RECEIVE+SEND / client RECEIVE.
//!
//! Uses the direct libc `read`/`write` (what a C program and lmbench use), not the generic `syscall`
//! gate, which is ~200 ns slower here and would under-count. `rustc` emits a benign "suspicious
//! runtime symbol" warning for declaring `read`/`write`; it is expected and the declarations match
//! libc exactly. Native numbers are statistical (a shared desktop underneath), so take a median.
//!
//! Build and run natively (no Cargo, so it does not fight the aarch64 workspace target):
//!   rustc -O bench/host/ipc_rtt.rs -o /tmp/ipc_rtt && /tmp/ipc_rtt
