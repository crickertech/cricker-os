//! The tests for milestone 106 (a wait that ends on either the interrupt or the deadline), which
//! builds DECISIONS §147 (a timer a userspace service cannot hold) option 1, on every architecture.
//!
//! Each proves something the crate's Kani harnesses cannot, because it is about the kernel half:
//! that the real tick reaches the walk, that the walk's signal wakes a real waiter (and a bound
//! receiver parked in `RECEIVE`) through §101 (notification objects)'s path, and that the syscall layer checks the right
//! rights on the right objects. The arithmetic (the cache never passes an armed deadline, a walk
//! fires exactly the due timers, a replaced or cancelled deadline never fires) is proved in
//! `crates/inter_process_communication/src/timer.rs` and exercised here only end to end.
//!
//! **Timing assertions are one-sided where they can be.** "Not before the deadline" is exact,
//! because the walk compares the same counter the test reads. "Soon after" is bounded loosely (a
//! second), because a loaded CI runner under TCG can lose ticks, and a test that flaked on host
//! load would prove nothing about the kernel.
