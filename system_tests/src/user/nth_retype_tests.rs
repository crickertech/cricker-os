//! **`login` survives a failed retype at every point of a login** (milestone 757 (a test kernel
//! fails a process on its Nth retype), provisional; raised by milestone 745 (count the error paths
//! no test reaches) and approved by calef on 2026-10-04 UTC).
//!
//! `crate::retype_fault` makes the kernel refuse one thread's Nth retype as though the region were
//! empty. This sweeps N over one whole login against `login` (the `CONNECT` on the front door, the
//! credential relay, `mint`'s caretaker build, the client's budget), from 1 until a run makes fewer
//! than N retypes, which is a login that ran to the end. After every run it compares `login`'s
//! capability table and the usage of every region `login` holds against what they were before the
//! sweep. A cleanup path that forgets a `cap_delete` or leaves a split child behind crashes nothing;
//! the slot or the pages it kept are the only evidence, and these two counters are where the kernel
//! keeps them. `notes/untested-error-paths.md` counted 17 such paths in `login` that no test had
//! reached.
//!
//! **Kernel internals it observes, and why no syscall shows them** (`notes/scripts.md`, a new
//! service test is a userspace program unless it cannot be): another process's capability table,
//! and which retype the kernel is on. A program can read neither about `login`.
//!
//! It shares `login_tests`' one `login` instance rather than building its own, because a `login`
//! cannot be torn down (it parks on a front door its own budget did not pay for; `holding.rs`'s
//! BUGS), so a second instance would be a permanent charge on the suite's frame ledger. Every run
//! here either is refused or logs back out ([`ls::LOGOUT`]), so it leaves that instance as it found
//! it, which is the property under test.
//!
//! Cross-ISA: one portable body over portable kernel code, DECISIONS §19 (architectural parity is a
//! tenet).
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **One program, one exchange.** `login`'s own start-up (the three splits in `_start`) and a
//!   login that opens a schedule (`Durable::open`) are not swept; each needs a fresh `login` per N,
//!   which is the teardown `holding.rs` cannot do. `system_initializer`, `swish` and the rest of
//!   the 75 cleanup paths are not swept either. All of it is
//!   `design/roadmap/proposals/sweep-the-other-long-lived-services-under-the-retype-fault.md`.
//! - **x86_64 skips the `login` sweep**, as it skips every `login_tests` test: its test boot
//!   attaches no RedoxFS disk. The hook is portable kernel code, and
//!   [`the_nth_retype_fails_as_an_empty_region_would_and_no_other`] runs on x86_64 too.
//! - **It sees leaks, not wrong answers past the first.** After a refused run `login` must answer
//!   `DENIED` and the next exchange must work; anything subtler than that and the two counters is
//!   not checked.
