//! **What `free`, `vmstat` and `slabtop` read, proved in the kernel** (milestone 126 (the `procps` package), DECISIONS
//! §225 (`free` sees the machine and your share)).
//!
//! Two mechanisms, and each is tested where it could be wrong. `MemoryRegion::USAGE` is a method
//! with a rights gate, so it is driven through the real dispatcher with capabilities holding exactly
//! one right each. The machine statistics page is counters written from the scheduler, so it is
//! read through its protocol crate and checked for the two things only a running kernel can make
//! true: that the page exists and is recognized, and that its counters move.
//!
//! Arch-neutral: nothing here, nor in `crate::machine_statistics`, is under `arch/`, so all three
//! architectures run these assertions (DECISIONS §19 (architectural parity is a tenet)).
