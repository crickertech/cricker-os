//! `unmap_tests`: `abi::address_space::UNMAP` (milestone 95 (an unmap primitive), DECISIONS §162
//! (whether a holder can give up a mapping), option A), driven
//! through the real syscall dispatcher against a real `Object::AddressSpace`, with what the space
//! maps read back from its page tables (`arch::mmu::translate_at`) and its mapping record
//! (`AddressSpace::LIST`) rather than taken from the call's return value. `pmap_tests`' shape and
//! its `tidy` discipline, one method over.
//!
//! Cross-ISA, because the whole of the method is portable kernel code over `mmu::unmap_user_at`,
//! and a divergence here means something under `arch/` disagrees about what unmapping a page is.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **No test here watches a TLB on another core.** These four build spaces no thread runs in.
//!   `running_space_tests` has the ones that do, since §249 (a running address space stays
//!   nameable) made a running space nameable: a reader spinning on another core faults once its
//!   page is given up.
//! - **Intermediate tables are not checked.** `UNMAP` leaves them linked on purpose, and this module
//!   does not assert either way.
