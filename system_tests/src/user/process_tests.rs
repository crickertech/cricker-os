//! `process_tests`: the process object (milestone 812 (`std::thread::spawn` runs real threads in
//! one address space); §269 (how threads share a process) forks 1, 3 and 5, as calef ruled them on
//! pull request #1892).
//!
//! Two hand-written threads join one process through `CONFIGURE` with a `BIND` capability and
//! share its space, its capability table and a futex; a sibling's `exit` ends the main thread and
//! its supervisor hears; `DESTROY` and a destroyed region end every member; and each refusal the
//! contract states is made. One stub per ISA for each program, so the same claims hold on all three
//! (§19 (architectural parity is a tenet)).
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A killed member runs on until its next preemption**, the §16 (object revocation) amendment's
//!   mechanism, so these tests wait for members to go rather than asserting they are gone the
//!   instant a process ends. `notes/processes.md` records it.
