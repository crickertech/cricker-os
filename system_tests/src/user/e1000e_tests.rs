//!
//! The same `net_stack`, the same smoltcp, the same socket contract and the same client role as
//! the virtio gates in `tests.rs`, with one thing changed: the NIC is QEMU's `e1000e` (an Intel
//! 82574L, the family xenon's I219 belongs to), reset and programmed by the kernel and driven at
//! EL0 through two pages of BAR0 and a DMA region confined by the IOMMU. **One module for all three
//! architectures**, because this is the first NIC the x86_64 leg has, and the parity claim is that
//! the same cases pass on each.
//!
//! What a pass here is not: a claim about the I219. QEMU's model is the 82574L; xenon's bench step
//! (notes/e1000e.md) is what proves the real part.
