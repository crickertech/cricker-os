# The nine things that would kill nife

*Name: provisional, minted 2026-09-23 by the lane that split the file (`7b4c6b4f2`), for the
directory and every appendix stem in it. Each appendix's own preamble says the same of its stem.
Naming is calef's; `script/names --unratified` lists each stem.*

The nine risk files are ratified (2026-10-05, UTC; calef, PR #1675: "Use the claim forms."): each
stem states its risk's claim. Refused `5-multicore-reliability` and `6-userspace-driver-speed`,
which name a topic rather than the claim.

calef, 2026-08-30: *"something that would kill nife for me as a project is a fatal characteristic
that would demonstrate the approach isn't viable... We should then try to prove or disprove those
things."*

This directory is the falsification list. Not a risk register, which tracks things that might go badly. It
is a list of claims that, if false, mean the project should stop. A risk you can mitigate belongs in
a milestone. A risk you can only answer belongs here.

It was written the same week the project's first customer left, when the family's backups moved to
borg over SSH on cordoba because nife was not ready. With no customer, the ranking function has
nothing to rank by. The substitute is "find out whether this can work at all."

It is a six-pager, and the depth is in appendices (calef, 2026-09-23). At 17,742 words, reading it
once cost a maintainer session most of a context window. A reader can decide what to work on next from
this page and the nine entries, without opening a single appendix. Each entry links one, in
[`design/fatal-risks/`](.), holding that risk's evidence, numbers, corrections and refusals
for anyone who wants to verify or challenge a verdict. Each entry has a file of its own since
2026-10-05 (calef), because one shared file was the conflict point for merge-queue ejections. Studies with a home of their own stay in
`notes/`. Superseded numbers are in `git log -p -- design/fatal-risks/`.

## The rule an entry has to meet

Three properties, and an entry that lacks one is a worry rather than a risk:

1. It can come back red. An experiment that can only confirm is not a test. Where an experiment
   is structurally confirmation-biased, the entry says so and names the second pass that fixes it
   (risk 2 is the worked example).
2. The experiment is cheap relative to the project. A test that costs a year answers a question
   the year would have answered anyway.
3. It does not wait on more of the project being built. Otherwise it is a schedule, not a test.

The ranking is chance-of-fatal times cheapness-of-test, which is why the running order at the bottom
is not the numbering. The numbers are identity, like a milestone's.

## Who may change an entry

Verdicts are the architect's: the Experiment status word, the colour and the running order. The
maintainer corrects a factual error (a wrong date or instrument, a claim the machine disproves)
without asking, dated and citing its source. Facts arguing for a new verdict go to the architect.
[§216 (fatal-risk facts are correctable, and verdicts are the architect's)](../decisions/216-fatal-risk-facts-are-correctable-verdicts-are-the-architects.md),
2026-09-25.

## What an entry's Experiment status says, and the three words it may say it in

Every risk file opens with a frontmatter block carrying one Experiment status, `experiment_status:`,
and, when the status is `RUN`, the date it ran as `experiment_run:` (both names ratified 2026-10-05 by calef). The
field answers one question: has the experiment happened. calef moved it out of a bold line and into
frontmatter on 2026-10-05 (UTC), and `script/fatal-risks` fails on the old bold line. calef ratified the field and its three values on 2026-09-23, in
§211 (what a fatal-risk verdict says, and what the chart can plot as a result).
`script/fatal-risks` fails on a fourth value, because the set was open until then and three lanes
minted three words in one day. The script's own header carries the ratification and the refusals.

| value | what it asserts |
|---|---|
| `RUN` | the experiment has been performed, whatever it found |
| `NOT-RUN` | it has not been performed, and could be |
| `CANNOT-RUN` | it cannot be performed at all, and the entry says what would change that |

What it does not say is what the experiment found. That is prose, and it is where `GREEN`, `AMBER`,
`MEASURED` and `AUDITED` live. None of the four is a value of this field. A reader who wants to know
whether nife is in trouble reads the paragraph. The colour has one machine-read home, the
appendix's `color:`, and the entry's verdict sentence is the prose it must agree with; the risk files
carry no `color:` key.

## The nine, one file each

A risk's file holds the claim of record: its status, its experiment, its cost and its caveats. Each links an appendix with the evidence.

2. [The proofs prove trivia, and the real bugs live where Kani cannot reach](2-the-proofs-prove-trivia.md)
3. [The tests do not test anything, and the quality is illusory](3-the-tests-do-not-test.md)
4. [The architecture imposes a per-crossing cost that cannot be engineered away](4-the-per-crossing-cost.md)
5. [It cannot be made reliable on multicore, and the bugs appear only on silicon](5-not-reliable-on-multicore.md)
6. [A capability-confined userspace driver cannot drive real hardware at real speed](6-a-confined-driver-is-too-slow.md)
7. [The confinement claim is false](7-the-confinement-claim.md)
8. [Nobody needs it](8-nobody-needs-it.md)
9. [The HAL is a fiction, and an architecture costs a restructure rather than a port, and so does the next machine](9-the-hal-is-a-fiction.md)

## The running order

Ranked by chance-of-fatal times cheapness-of-test, not by number. Each cell's verdict is the entry's.

| order | risk | experiment | owner | cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~1~~ | 2, the proofs | **RUN, 2026-08-30: amber**, because no standing proof has caught a regression, and `asm!` bounds the reach | milestone 191 | done |
| 2 | 9, the HAL, on the board that already boots | the on-board test-suite exit, so silicon becomes gate-able | milestone 16 (real hardware and IOMMU-backed driver isolation) | bench time, board proven since 2026-08-14. Correction, 2026-10-05: milestone 16 is `BUILT` (2026-10-03), and its block records this exit as done by 2026-09-03, the board feature's UART verdict marker and SBI SRST in `kernel/src/arch/riscv64/semihosting.rs` ([16's block](../roadmap/16-real-hardware-iommu.md), `## Follow-on`). Whether that closes the row is the architect's |
| ~~3~~ | 9, the HAL, on the architecture that carries the risk | **RUN, 2026-09-17: GREEN**, five of five on xenon, everything it needed inside `arch/x86_64/` | milestone 87 (the x86_64 bare-metal machine) | done |
| 4 | 9, the HAL, at the implementation grain, widened 2026-09-23 | a second machine of an architecture nife already boots | milestone 225 (run the soak on radon, argon and xenon) | **RULED 2026-10-06: riscv64 first** (calef, *"We can do the Scaleway first"*): milestone 89 (Scaleway EM-RV1), €1.51, then argon (the TX1) when it arrives; neither run. History: ruled 2026-10-05 "both, argon first"; on 2026-10-06 argon proved not in hand, as the seller shipped a TK1 against the TX1 order (`notes/bench-runbook.md`) |
| ~~4~~ | 1, the ecosystem | **RUN, 2026-08-31: GREEN on all three since 2026-09-16.** `rg` has not yet searched: it stopped at a missing argv, now built, and its walk and threads were never reached (corrected 2026-10-06) | milestone 121 (`ripgrep` on nife) | done |
| ~~5~~ | 3, the tests | **RUN, 2026-09-19: amber.** 96.1% like-for-like against 92.4% on 2026-09-21, and 771 missed survivors (414 projected after #1277) hold the amber | milestone 326 | done; the triage remains |
| ~~6~~ | 4, performance | **RUN, 2026-10-04: GREEN** (calef, 2026-10-05; amber 2026-10-04). Throughput held, and the null syscall's rise under load was a fixable lock and false sharing, now 10 ticks of growth | milestone 168 (a multi-tasking workload benchmark); milestone 761 (capability lookup off the global lock) and milestone 766 (each core's PerCpu on its own cache line) done | done; about 5 ticks of growth remain undecomposed |
| 7 | 9 and 6 together | journey 3, end to end on three boards | journey 3 | months, and it is the capstone |
| -- | 5, multicore | **RUN on radon, 2026-09-25:** 8 hours clean, 4.1 million crossings. A linear defect-discovery curve is the red result | milestone 201 (is multicore reliability converging) | weeks, hardware |
| -- | 7, confinement | **RUN, 2026-08-31, extended 2026-09-16, AUDITED 2026-09-17: amber** (calef, 2026-10-03). A confinement test could not fail, and DECISIONS §12 was false on x86_64. Fixed. The outsider half remains | milestone 633 (an outside agent attacks the confinement claim); 202, 305 and 313 done | one agent run, token cost uncosted |
| -- | 8, nobody needs it | **CANNOT-RUN, 2026-09-23.** No experiment, and none available: milestone 576 (how many systems are out there, and what do they run) is behind milestone 801 (packages over the internet), rung 3c of milestone 198 (a package manager) until 198 was split on 2026-10-06 | milestone 576 | blocked, not costed |

## BUGS

- ~~Nothing gates these entries.~~ Closed 2026-09-11 for the mechanical half by milestone 275 (a gate
  that diffs fatal risks against the roadmap it cites). `script/fatal-risks --check` runs
  in `script/lint` and compares what the nine entries claim about a milestone or a decision against what
  the record holds. It found four live disagreements on its first run.

  What is not closed is the larger half. A gate can see a status word contradicting the record. It
  cannot see a premise being overtaken, which is what happened to risk 9's cost line: it priced
  milestone 87 as bench time when `notes/x86-port.md` already recorded that no real firmware speaks
  PVH. A green `script/fatal-risks` means no status word here contradicts the record it names. It is
  not a warrant that the arguments still hold.
- Nothing gates an appendix. `script/fatal-risks` parses this page and the nine risk files, so a verdict restated under
  `design/fatal-risks/` can drift and no check will say so. The appendices therefore do not carry the
  Experiment status field at all, and each says at its head that this document is the claim of
  record. That is rung three of AGENTS.md's ladder, and honest about being rung three.
- The bold the risk files carry is the gate's, not the prose's. `script/fatal-risks` reads the
  experiment lead-ins and the running order's verdict cells as markup, so those spans are machinery
  rather than emphasis. The Experiment status lines left that list on 2026-10-05 (UTC), when calef
  moved them into frontmatter. Every other bold span is gone, and what is left spends the whole
  writing-convention budget of four per thousand words. Editing an entry means spending the gate's
  budget, not your own. calef ruled on 2026-09-24 (UTC) that markup a gate parses is counted like any
  other bold, so no exclusion exists. Until the lead-ins move too, do not add a bolded span to an
  entry without removing one.
- ~~Two entries have no owner.~~ Closed 2026-08-31: risks 5 and 7 are milestones 201 and 202, both
  scoped by calef and both reframed in the process, risk 7's by §134 (a harness carries a
  machine-replayable falsification record, or it is not evidence). Neither can return a clean green,
  and both blocks say so where a reader meets them.
- The ranking is a judgement, not a calculation. "Chance of fatal" is nobody's measurement, and two
  readers could order this differently on the same evidence.
- A green result is not proof of anything. Every experiment here can only fail to kill the project.
- The word budget is a constraint on these documents, not on the truth. calef asked for 3,000 words
  and accepted 4,235 on 2026-09-24 (UTC) for the single file. Splitting it one file per risk on
  2026-10-05 put this page near 1,900 words and the largest entry (risk 7) near 1,700, so the exception
  marker is gone and nothing here uses it. Put any growth in the appendix beside the entry.
