# The backup-server ladder (53 to 55), and why it is the right deliverable

calef's goal, 2026-07-30: the board should replace the drive hanging off his router as the Time
Machine target. These three milestones are that goal decomposed honestly, and they are worth doing
for a reason beyond utility.

It is a real workload with a real user. Every other thing this project measures is a benchmark or
a test. This one gets used by people who did not write it, which changes what "works" means.

And the stakes are exactly right, which matters more than they would be if they were higher
(calef, 2026-07-30). This is **not** his durable backup: Borg handles offsite, and the board's job
is protecting against short-term mistakes. So losing the whole thing costs the ability to undo a bad
afternoon, not any data. That is the ideal shape for a demonstrator target: genuine use, tolerable
failure. Putting an experimental capability microkernel in front of someone's only copy would be
reckless; putting it in front of their convenience layer is a real test with a bounded downside, and
the entry should not pretend otherwise to sound weightier.

It still exercises crash consistency for real. §34's RedoxFS conditions get tested against actual
power loss on actual hardware rather than a QEMU crash image, and correctness is still the goal. The
honest correction is only to the consequence of failure, not to the standard.

And it is the best security claim the thesis can make, because backup servers hold everything. On
a Linux box, Samba runs with broad authority over the machine. Here the file-serving component would
hold one directory capability and one network endpoint and nothing else, so a compromise reaches
the backup share and stops: not by policy, not by a hardening guide, but because no capability naming
anything else was ever given to it. That is worth more on a backup server than on almost any other
workload.
