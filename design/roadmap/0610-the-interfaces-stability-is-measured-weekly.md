# 610. The interface's stability is measured weekly

calef, 2026-09-27 (UTC): "What I want are good metrics for capturing the stability of our
interface." *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)* The metrics page gains a weekly
series for it, in the shape milestone 415 (sub-tripwire drift accumulates across baseline saves)
set in PR #1375: a helper, a CSV under `notes/project-metrics/`, a chart and a generated line.

## What shipped

- `helpers/interface_stability.py` (name provisional) reads each week's public API of the contract
  and std ABI crates from rustdoc's JSON (`--output-format json`, the pinned nightly, no new
  dependency), over a `git archive` of the week's tree. It writes
  `notes/project-metrics/interface-stability.csv`, back-filled to 2026W29. Five measures:
  - breaking changes and additions to the public API, with the std ABI broken out;
  - syscall surface changes: renumbered or removed, renamed with the number kept, and added;
  - format bumps, derived from `*VERSION*`, `*MAGIC*` and `*REVISION*` constants;
  - amendments, from a ledger at the format;
  - co-change, by the method behind #1389's 76%.
- A per-crate view, `interface-stability-crates.csv`, and a generated appendix listing it and this
  week's breaks by name.
- `script/metrics` carries the cells (it may not build, so it never recomputes them), draws
  `interface-stability.svg` with a four-week trend, and writes the headline line.
- `.github/workflows/metrics.yml` runs the helper before `script/metrics --update`. It already
  commits `notes/project-metrics.md` beside the directory (#1375's fix), so nothing it writes is
  dropped.
- `--selftest`, 40 fixture cases with no git and no cargo, runs in `script/lint`.
- [notes/interface-stability.md](../../notes/interface-stability.md): what the interface is,
  checked against the tree, what each column counts, the first reading, a threshold proposal, and
  the blind spots in its BUGS section.

## Proposals for calef

- PROPOSED: the threshold for "stable". The note's proposal is, over four weeks, no syscall number
  renumbered or removed, no in-place format change, and at most four contract breaking changes; a
  crate is settled after four weeks with none. Co-change is reported, not thresholded.
- PROPOSED: the `# Amendments` ledger convention, a dated list in a format crate's module
  documentation. Provisional; `manifest_note` should carry the first entry when its in-place
  amendment of version 1 merges.

Names provisional: the helper, the note, both CSVs, the appendix, the chart, every
`interface_*` column and the ledger heading.

## Follow-on

- **Recorded.** The threshold for "stable" is calef's call; the proposal and its reasoning are in
  `notes/interface-stability.md`, "What stable would mean", and the PROPOSED entry above.
- **Recorded.** The amendment ledger convention and its first owed entry (`manifest_note`'s version
  1, amended in place on 2026-09-27 on a branch not yet merged) are in `notes/interface-stability.md`,
  "The amendment ledger". Nothing checks that an in-place amendment has an entry; that is in the
  same note's BUGS.
- **Recorded.** Every blind spot of the five measures, including that only the aarch64 view of each
  crate is read (a `cfg(target_arch)` item for riscv64 or x86_64 is not seen), is in the BUGS
  section of `notes/interface-stability.md`.
- **Refused.** `cargo-semver-checks` and `cargo-public-api`. rustdoc's JSON already answers whether
  the public surface moved; the tools answer whether a change needs a major version, and each would
  be a §46 (thin primitives or whole subsystems) dependency tied to the nightly pin. Reasoning in
  `notes/interface-stability.md`.
- **Recorded.** A per-package co-change column is owed, alongside the division-level co-change
  this milestone already carries. §235 (the OS is built and updated from packages, and the tree
  divides by what releases together)'s Fork 3 amendment (calef, 2026-09-27T15:06Z, question 7c)
  rules that a home is sized by what changes together. No package moves to a new home before this
  measurement exists. Not built here.

## Index row

The interface a program is written against now has a weekly series on the metrics page: the
contract crates, the syscall surface in `abi`, the wire formats and the std ABI. It is back-filled
from git to 2026W29 by reading each week's public API from rustdoc's JSON. It counts breaking changes next to
additions, syscall renumbers apart from renames, format bumps and recorded amendments, and how often
a contract commit also touches another division. Its first reading is 121 breaking changes and 449
additions over the last four weeks, which is what "not yet stable" looks like in numbers, and it
gives calef something to set a stability threshold against.
