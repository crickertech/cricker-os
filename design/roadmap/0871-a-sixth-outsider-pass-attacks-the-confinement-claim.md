# 871. A sixth outsider pass attacks the confinement claim

*(Minted 2026-10-10 (UTC) by this lane as the maintainer's delegate, the way milestone 800 (a
non-Anthropic model attacks the confinement claim) was minted. The number 871 is provisional; other
lanes are minting nearby, so expect renumbering at merge. Title, slug and every name below are
drafts. Renumbered from 868 on 2026-10-10 (UTC), because a concurrently merged lane, relibc's seed
coming under the unsafe gates, took 868 on main and 869 went the same day. It went to 870 and then,
the same day, to 871, because the lane keeping main's CI caches warm (#1906) claimed 870 at the
same moment and its claim was the visible one. The branch and pull
request #1901 keep the old number: GitHub closes a pull request whose head branch is renamed, and
#1901 carries calef's ruling.)*

**Reuse:** the counting rule, the report format and the refusal log are milestone 800's, unchanged,
so the passes compare row for row. This pass is by GLM 5.3, the non-Anthropic model that ran pass 4
(milestone 800), so it serves criterion (c)'s non-Anthropic half. If the fifth pass (PR #1895,
Anthropic, unmerged when this was written) lands clean, this pass can be the second of the two
consecutive clean passes.

## Index row

The sixth outsider pass at risk 7's confinement claim, by GLM 5.3 (non-Anthropic). It attacks the
newest shipped surfaces first, the milestone 801 (packages over the internet) fetch path, then the
§255 (each socket is its own capability) socket-capability model as variants of pass 5's ground.
It counts an attack only when it boots, and keeps the standing refusal log.

## Why

Risk 7 (the confinement claim is false) is AMBER. Its criterion (c) for green is two consecutive
independent attacks with no escape on a shipped path, at least one by a non-Anthropic model or a
human. A pass that leaves a refusal on a shipped path unexamined does not count (calef, "Add the
refusal log."). Pass 4 (milestone 800) booted the socket capture of milestone 649 (every client of
a network stack shares its socket numbers) and restarted the count at zero. The fifth pass (PR
#1895, Anthropic, unmerged when this was written) found no escape; once it lands, this pass is the
second of the two, and it supplies the non-Anthropic half.

## The attack

Informed, the posture milestone 800 set: the whole tree and its history are in hand, as any
attacker of a public repository has them. Variant analysis against each fixed escape, and new
ground where nothing has been found. The surfaces, newest first:

- The milestone 801 package fetch path, shipped 2026-10-10 in PRs #1884 and #1890. Its parts:
  `package_index`'s admission of a hostile index (Q1's private and link-local refusal, the "moved
  to" field) and the client's two index addresses. Then digest admission through
  `package_archive::installable_as`, the §252 (a resolver grant is one zone per client badge)
  resolver badge behind std's `ToSocketAddrs`, and the fetch pinned to one TLS root.
- The §255 socket-capability model, as variants of pass 5's booted row-34 ground.
- The 34 rows of the claims table, re-read, each attacked or refused with a written reason.

## Result

PARTIAL, 2026-10-10 (UTC). The pass booted one escape on its first surface and stopped there. The
milestone 801 (packages over the internet) package client checked one resolution of a listed
location's host, then connected by name, which resolved again. A rebinding name server answered
the check public and the connect private, and the client reached the private peer Q1 forbids. The
failing test went in first. calef ruled on #1901 (21:04 UTC): "Yes, it is an escape on a shipped
path. It was literally just shipped, but counts." Criterion (c)'s count restarted at zero. Then
"Yes, launch the fix": `package_index::Location::check` hands back the one resolution it passed as a
`CheckedLocation`, and the client dials only those addresses and keeps the host name for TLS. The
test is green on aarch64, riscv64 and x86_64, and red on all three when connect-by-name is patched
back.

Not done: the 34-row sweep and the variant work against the fixed escapes. With the count already
at zero, they could no longer make this pass a clean one. See
`notes/confinement-outsider-pass-6.md` for the escape, the fix and the refusal log.

## Done means

- Every claim has an attack, or a written reason it was not attacked.
- Every escape is a failing test committed before any fix.
- The pass-6 note exists with its refusal log, and is indexed in `notes/README/` and its area page,
  which pass 5's draft forgot and lint caught.
- Risk 7's appendix cites the pass through the maintainer under §216 (fatal-risk facts are
  correctable, and verdicts are the architect's). Moving the color stays calef's.

## Follow-on

- **Outstanding.** The rest of this pass: the 34-row sweep and the variant work, unrun. A seventh
  pass starts criterion (c)'s count afresh and would cover the same rows, so this remainder is
  likely superseded by it rather than run on its own; that is the maintainer's call when it is
  minted.
- **Milestone 855.** A claims-table row for the package fetch: "A listed location never reaches a
  private or link-local address" has no row in `notes/confinement-claims.md`. Criterion (b) wants
  every row replayable, and this test's falsification can only be `attested` until milestone 855
  (the TLS graph enters the gated build) puts the exerciser in a gate, so the row waits on 855.
- **Milestone 198.** A human review, or a public bounty once a stranger can install nife, is the
  stronger form and waits on milestone 198 (a package manager, and the trivial install that makes
  a second customer possible).
- **Milestone 825.** The redoxfs name-window TOCTOU remains the open shipped-path refusal both
  passes declined to boot; its probe belongs to milestone 825 (a hostile client races the file
  server's name window), NOT-STARTED.
