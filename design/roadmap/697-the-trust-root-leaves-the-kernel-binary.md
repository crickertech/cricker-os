# The trust root leaves the kernel binary

calef ruled this on 2026-09-27, beside the ruling that moved the system tests out of the kernel
crate (milestone 609 (the system tests leave the kernel crate)). Today `kernel/build.rs` compiles
the progenitor's digest and the base manifest's digests into `TRUST_ROOT`, so a kernel binary is a
function of every base program's bytes, and no kernel build can happen before userspace is built
and the archive packed. Milestone 609 removed the crate coupling; this is the build coupling that
is left.

The ruled shape: the loader hands the kernel the progenitor's digest and the base manifest's digest,
the kernel checks only the progenitor, and the progenitor checks the base set. What it needs
decided first is the handoff (a boot-protocol field on three architectures, which is a wire format)
and where the loader's own copy of the digests comes from.

The measurements behind the coupling are in pull request #1389's note on packages and divisions,
under "the trust root".
