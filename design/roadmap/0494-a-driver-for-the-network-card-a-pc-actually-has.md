# 494. A driver for the network card a PC actually has

*(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)* Promoted from the
proposal `a-driver-for-the-network-card-a-pc-actually-has`, filed 2026-09-19, on calef's instruction
of 2026-09-20 to give every proposal on `main` a number. The text below is the proposal's own,
unedited except for this paragraph: the argument is its author's and promotion is not the moment to
improve it. Written by milestone 198 (a package manager, and the trivial install)'s rungs lane (`milestone/198-rungs-to-a-trivial-install`) for
rung 3 of the trivial install DECISIONS §157 (a trivial install is a web page,) defines: packages over the internet need a network
card, and the only one nife can drive is virtio-net, which no physical machine has.

The driver is written and tested under QEMU, which emulates the family xenon has.
The bench half needs xenon powered, which is the same attended boot milestone 261 needs.

## What was built, 2026-10-04

Exit criterion 1 is met; criterion 2 is calef's bench step, staged and written down. Procedure,
evidence and the confinement finding: [notes/e1000e.md](../../notes/e1000e.md).

- The datasheet question, answered from the register map. Ring base and ring tail share a
  4 KiB page (`0x2800`/`0x2818`, `0x3800`/`0x3818`, read from Linux's `regs.h`; Intel's I219
  datasheet was not read). So the process that moves a tail can repoint the ring, and VT-d is the
  whole of the DMA confinement on this device, as the section below predicted. Watched rather
  than assumed: with the kernel's `iommu::confine` skipped, QEMU's VT-d refused the NIC's first
  ring fetch and no lease came.
- Milestone 261 (the NVMe driver leaves the kernel)'s shape, which DECISIONS §86 (whether an NVMe
  driver can leave the kernel) authorized for NVMe, and no new syscall surface. The kernel
  (`kernel/src/e1000e.rs`) resets the NIC, reads its MAC address and programs the ring bases; the
  process is handed BAR0's two queue pages and an 18-page confined DMA region, and is denied page 0
  and page 5 (reset, the receive filter, the MAC address, the PHY). It polls; no interrupt is
  granted. The spawn is `kernel/src/user/e1000e_service.rs`.
- Inside `net_stack`, as recommended below, through a `Nic` enum that now carries smoltcp's
  `phy::Device` for both NICs, with full 1514-byte frames. The recommendation was about effort,
  and it is recorded that way in `components/src/e1000e_transport.rs`.
- `crates/e1000e` holds every computed thing: register map, descriptor formats, the DMA layout,
  the spawn handoff (a crate, by rule 7), and the whole receive and transmit ring logic behind two
  traits. 14 host tests against a simulated device and 3 Kani harnesses, each with a replayable
  falsification patch.
- The gates, on all three architectures, as DECISIONS §19 (architectural parity is a tenet)
  requires. `system_tests/src/user/e1000e_tests.rs` passes milestone 30 (the network stack as a
  confined component)'s DHCP and TCP gates over QEMU's `e1000e` behind each machine's IOMMU. It
  adds a UDP round trip and rung 3a's package fetch. All four are green locally on aarch64, riscv64
  and x86_64 (PVH and OVMF). No scope note is owed: QEMU attaches `e1000e` on every bus the
  runners have.
- x86_64 has a NIC under QEMU for the first time. The OVMF runner turned out to have carried
  QEMU's default `e1000e` all along, unchosen; it is now explicit.
- The bench boot: `cargo xtask network-bench` stages a `network_bench` kernel that prints the
  NIC, the DMAR preflight, the lease, a timed transfer from a LAN peer, and one verdict, and
  rehearses it under OVMF.

## What was built, 2026-10-05

The I219's PHY half. QEMU's 82574L never takes the PCH path, so xenon is still the test.

- FreeBSD's SPT-class attach and reset path in `crates/e1000e/src/pch/` (Reuse, below): MDIO
  under the semaphore (`phy.rs`), the NVM read (`nvm.rs`), and FreeBSD's three passes
  (`sequence.rs`), called by the kernel through a small `Hw` trait.
- Fifteen host tests against a simulated I219 (`pch/sim.rs`). The semaphore is a non-`Clone` token,
  so a PHY access without it does not compile. One falsifiable Kani harness; writing it found that
  FreeBSD truncates a page select above `0x7ff`, which this port refuses.
- QEMU proves the MDIO read: the DHCP gate asserts the 82574L's PHY identifier, `0x01410cb0`.
- The boot refusal's lift is one constant, `e1000e_service::PCH_PROVEN_ON_SILICON`, still `false`.

## What was checked, 2026-10-06

No new code. The runbook now expects what xenon already printed (below, and `BUGS`), and
`cargo xtask network-bench` rehearsed green on `ab9ae95aa`.

## Bench runbook: one boot on xenon (calef)

Whole, with every failure ending and the Results table: notes/e1000e.md, "calef's bench step on
xenon". The one command, on patagonia, after that section's peer loop:

```sh
git log -1 --format=%h && cargo xtask network-bench --stage-only --peer "$P:9494" && cp target/esp-network-bench/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI /Volumes/NIFE/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI && diskutil eject /Volumes/NIFE
```

Success ends `network-bench: verdict LEASED-AND-MEASURED`.

## Which card xenon has, and the tree disagreed with itself

xenon's network card is an Intel I219-LM. Dell's specification sheet for the OptiPlex 7050 says
*"Integrated Intel® i219-LM Ethernet LAN 10/100/1000"* (read on 2026-09-19 from
`i.dell.com/.../OptiPlex-7050-Towers-Technical-Specifications.pdf`). The firmware's System
Information page names no model (`notes/xenon-firmware.md`).

Two records in the tree said otherwise, citing nothing: milestone 260 (boot xenon over the
network)'s `BUGS` and `script/netboot-rehearsal`'s header called it *"a Broadcom LOM"*. Both were
corrected on 2026-10-04 (UTC) by #1641.

**Settled by xenon itself, 2026-10-04 (UTC).** The PCI survey of that evening's boots, transcribed
in `bench/xenon-2026-10-04/install-and-disk-boot.log`, prints `00:1f.6 8086:15e3 class 020000`.
`0x15e3` is the I219-LM5, a Sunrise Point class part in FreeBSD's `e1000_pch_spt`, and it is in
`e1000e::DEVICE_IDS`. The same survey shows the Intel 8265 wireless card (`02:00.0 8086:24fd class
028000`) and the Management Engine (`00:16.0 8086:a2ba`, with AMT's serial function at `00:16.3`),
so the bench boot should take the ME branch of leaving ultra-low-power mode.

## What a stranger's PC most plausibly has

A judgment, with the parts recalled rather than read marked. Desktop boards mostly carry an Intel
or a Realtek gigabit or 2.5-gigabit controller (Intel I219, I225 or I226; Realtek RTL8111 or
RTL8125, recalled). Many laptops have no Ethernet port at all, and Wi-Fi is a different order of
work (firmware blobs, 802.11 management, WPA), so it is out of scope and recorded in `BUGS`. A USB
Ethernet adapter is the plausible bridge for such a laptop, and it rides on milestone 242's host
controller, so it is a follow-on to 242 rather than to this.

## Options for the first card (reversible, recommended)

| | Card | QEMU model | Who has it | Kept or lost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1. Intel I219, `e1000e` family | xenon's | Yes: QEMU emulates `e1000e` (milestone 87 (the x86_64 bare-metal machine), checked against the pinned QEMU binary) | xenon; a large share of business desktops (recalled) | Recommended. Developed under QEMU, proved on the bench machine, one driver spanning both, which is the property milestone 87 bought xenon for |
| N2. Intel I225/I226, `igc` | Protectli VP2430, newer boards | No (milestone 87: *"It does not emulate `igc`"*) | Newer desktops | Lost as the first: no emulator, and nobody here owns one. Milestone 87 says `igc` is `igb`'s descendant, so N1's shape carries |
| N3. Realtek | Common on consumer boards | QEMU has an old Realtek model, not the RTL8111 family (recalled) | Consumer desktops | Lost as the first: no bench machine and no emulator for the part |

## How it is confined, and which precedent it follows

Two drivers in this tree are the analogues, and they differ in the way that matters:

- virtio-net (milestone 30) runs inside `net_stack`: `components/src/virtio_net_transport.rs` is a
  `#[path]` module of that binary presenting smoltcp's `phy::Device`, and the kernel owns the
  device's registers and mediates it through a `Virtio` capability with the shadow-ring validator.
  None of that mediation exists for a non-virtio device.
- The EL0 NVMe server (milestone 261, DECISIONS §86 option 2a) is the precedent for a real
  device: the kernel keeps the admin plane, the process holds a page of BAR0 and a confined DMA
  window, and on xenon VT-d is the confinement. It added no syscall surface.

So the I219 driver takes 261's shape, and one difference is worth checking before the design is
drawn. NVMe's specification put a page boundary exactly where the authority boundary belongs
(controller registers below `0x1000`, doorbells above). For the `e1000e` family the ring base
registers and the ring tail registers sit in the same 4 KiB page (recalled from the older 8254x
datasheets, not read from the I219's), so the page split that let 261's server ring doorbells
without being able to repoint its rings may not exist here. If it does not, the driver can aim its
rings anywhere inside its IOMMU domain, and VT-d is the whole of the confinement, which is
milestone 261's own load-bearing unknown (whether xenon's DMAR scope covers the function) applied to
a second device. Read the datasheet first.

Where the driver runs is a second, smaller question: a second `phy::Device` inside `net_stack`
beside `virtio_net_transport`, as virtio-net does today, or its own process with frames crossing an
endpoint. Recommendation: inside `net_stack` first, matching the tree; a separate process is a
frame protocol two programs agree on, which is the expensive category and wants its own reason.
The §92 test: at equal cost the separate process would be preferred for confinement (a NIC parser
and a TCP stack in separate address spaces), so this recommendation is about effort and is
recorded as such.

## Costs, from the tree rather than adjectives

- Milestone 87's estimate: *"A minimal driver is 1,500-3,000 lines against Intel's public
  datasheet; the plumbing around it (PCI decode, DMA confinement, the userspace net server) already
  exists."* An estimate written at purchase time, not a measurement.
- The measured neighbours: `virtio_net_transport.rs` is 390 lines (virtio, with the kernel doing
  the register work); `components/src/non_volatile_memory_express.rs` is 417 lines and
  `crates/non_volatile_memory_express` 1,086, host-tested with Kani harnesses, which is the split
  this driver should copy.
- Interrupts: x86 does not yet route a device line to a userspace waiter (milestone 299 (the x86 port-range capability)'s scope
  note), and 261's server polls. The first NIC driver polls too.
- The MTU: `virtio_net_transport.rs` fixes `MTU = 576` because its whole DMA region is one page. A
  10 MB package at 576 bytes a frame is slow for no good reason; this driver gets a multi-page
  region the way 261's server got sixteen pages of transfer buffer, and full 1,500-byte frames.

## Exit criteria

1. Under QEMU, `-device e1000e` behind `intel-iommu`: `net_stack` completes a DHCP round trip
   and a TCP transfer through the new driver, the same gates milestone 30's virtio-net passes, on
   x86_64. aarch64 and riscv64 carry the driver too, since QEMU's `e1000e` is a PCIe device on
   every bus the runners attach, or a scope note says why not (DECISIONS §19).
2. On xenon, a DHCP lease from the house router and a measured transfer from a host on the LAN,
   photographed, with the survey line naming the card.

## Reuse

Reviewed 2026-10-04 (UTC), after calef's §46 (thin primitives or whole subsystems) amendment of the
same day: outside the kernel and the Kani-proved crates, take or adapt first, and record a reason
to write. Every row was read from its source, not recalled. Code lines exclude comments, blank
lines and tests.

| candidate | license | parts it claims | how it touches hardware | code lines | what carries into 261's shape |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Redox `e1000d` (`redox-os/drivers`, `net/e1000d`) | MIT | 8254x (`100e`, `100f`, `1004`), 82573L (`109a`), 82579V (`1503`). No 82574L, so not QEMU's `e1000e`; no I219 | a userspace daemon: `pcid` maps BAR0, `common::dma::Dma` allocates its own rings, an IRQ file, a `NetworkScheme` | 364 | register constants and the init order, which `crates/e1000e` already has. Nothing that allocates, maps or waits |
| `eth-intel` 0.2.4 (crates.io; rcore-os `tgoskits`) | MIT | `100e`, `100f` only | `mmio-api`, `dma-api`, `rdif-eth` traits from the ArceOS stack; owns DMA and IRQ | 412 | the same constants; its four dependencies would be §46 additions for none of the I219 |
| `e1000-driver` 0.1.0 (crates.io) | GPL-2.0 | 82540EP/EM | a kernel-module shape with its own allocator hooks | not counted | refused: it would be linked into `net_stack`, and §135 (running GPL software is aggregation) draws the GPL's line at the process boundary, where every linked GPL candidate before it was refused |
| FreeBSD `sys/dev/e1000` (`if_em.c`, `e1000_ich8lan.c`, `e1000_mac.c`, `e1000_phy.c`) | BSD-3-Clause (Intel) | every I219 generation, with field-found workarounds | C over FreeBSD's `iflib` and OS shims | about 16,000 across the four files | the I219's bring-up knowledge, which no Rust candidate has. Ported in part, below |

No Rust crate covers the 82574L or any I219, and no crate on crates.io names `e1000e` at all
(searched for `e1000`, `e1000e`, `i219`, `igb`, `intel-ethernet`).

Would adapting Redox's driver have been better than writing `crates/e1000e`? No, and not now
either. Its 364 lines map almost one for one onto this crate's 297 lines of register map and ring
logic, which is the easy part. It would not have run under QEMU without adding `10d3`, and every
line that allocates DMA, maps a BAR or waits on an interrupt is a Redox interface that 261's
shape replaces with a kernel control plane and spawn-time mappings. Its data path also trusts the
device: it slices a receive buffer by the descriptor's length unchecked (a length above 16 KiB
panics the driver), it enables promiscuous receive, and its reset, link and full-ring waits spin
without a bound. Adapting it would have saved perhaps a day on the register table and bought those
four defects to remove. What nife writes regardless is the split (`kernel/src/e1000e.rs`,
`e1000e_service`), the descriptor validation and its Kani proof, the host simulation, and the
`net_stack` integration; none of the candidates has any of it.

The I219 is where reuse pays, because that knowledge comes from field exposure. Against this
block's own BUGS list:

| I219 step | FreeBSD source | decision |
|---|---|---|
| leave ultra-low-power mode through the Management Engine | `e1000_disable_ulp_lpt_lp`, ME branch | ported, `crates/e1000e/src/pch/` (`ulp`, `sequence`) |
| empty the descriptor rings before a reset (SPT unit hang) | `em_flush_desc_rings`, `em_flush_tx_ring`, `em_flush_rx_ring` | ported, one recorded divergence (`pch::flush::tail_after`) |
| stop bus mastering before reset; STRAP writes around it; `KABGTXD.BGSQLBIAS` after | `e1000_disable_pcie_master_generic`, `e1000_reset_hw_ich8lan` | ported |
| leave ULP without an ME, the `SMBus` switch and `LANPHYPC`; the semaphore and MDIO; the PHY reset and its NVM-driven configuration; the SPT NVM read; hardware bits, copper link, transmit errata | `e1000_init_phy_workarounds_pchlan` and what it calls, `e1000_acquire_swflag_ich8lan`, `__e1000_read_phy_reg_hv`, `e1000_reset_hw_ich8lan`, `e1000_post_phy_reset_ich8lan`, `e1000_read_nvm_spt`, `e1000_init_hw_ich8lan`, `e1000_setup_copper_link_pch_lpt` | ported 2026-10-05, `pch/phy.rs`, `pch/nvm.rs`, `pch/sequence.rs`; each function's comment names its source, and the divergences are in `pch`'s `BUGS` |
| reconfiguration each time link comes up | `e1000_check_for_copper_link_ich8lan` | not ported: it runs from a link-change interrupt this driver does not take (Follow-on) |

Intel's license heads every adapted file. FreeBSD read at `main`, last `e1000_ich8lan.c` change
46cf612d (2026-08-30). Linux's GPL `e1000e` was not consulted for any I219 sequence; its headers
gave register offsets and ids as facts on 2026-10-04, and the ids were checked against FreeBSD's.

Recommendation. Keep `crates/e1000e`, recorded reason: no candidate covers QEMU's part or the I219,
and the code nife wrote is the confinement split and the input validation, which no candidate has.
Adapt FreeBSD for the I219, with attribution, in two steps: the MAC-register half now (done here),
and the PHY layer as its own piece (built 2026-10-05, so the one attended bench evening does not
meet a known gap). Take no dependency; vendor nothing.

## BUGS

- Intel's I219 datasheet is unread; every I219 fact here is FreeBSD's.
- Wi-Fi is out of scope, and on a laptop it is the only network there is. A stranger with a
  laptop and no USB Ethernet adapter cannot reach rung 3.
- One family. `igc` and Realtek are follow-ons with no emulator for either.
- xenon's DMAR scope for the NIC is inferred, not printed. xenon's DMAR has two units: one for
  named devices only and a catch-all, and both translated on 2026-10-04 (UTC)
  (`bench/xenon-2026-10-04/`). The NVMe ran confined at rate under the catch-all that evening.
  The NIC at `00:1f.6` is presumably under the same catch-all, but no line names its unit. The
  bench boot's preflight line answers it in print.
- Nothing has touched an I219: the PCH path is tested only against a simulation, and the bench
  runbook is its first run.
- xenon's room has no Ethernet port (calef, 2026-10-04); the runbook in notes/e1000e.md gives
  the three ways round it and what each proves.
- Intel's BSD license asks a binary redistribution to reproduce its notice in the
  documentation. The source carries it (`crates/e1000e/src/pch/`); no image or package this tree
  ships carries a third-party notices file, and none exists.

## Follow-on

- **Outstanding.** The bench runbook on xenon (exit criterion 2), which is calef's. Then a
  lane flips `PCH_PROVEN_ON_SILICON` in `kernel/src/user/e1000e_service.rs`, citing the Results
  row. Checked 2026-10-05: no xenon boot of this driver exists.
- **Done.** The booted system uses this NIC since 2026-10-05 (milestone 198 (a package manager)):
  the kernel builds `net_stack` on it when there is no virtio-net NIC and grants the progenitor its
  endpoint, and swish-check's x86_64 leg types the fetch lines. A PCH part is left alone at boot, so
  xenon gets a network only after exit criterion 2. `notes/e1000e.md`'s BUGS.
- **Recorded.** Polled with a 1 ms sleep, and one server at a time. `kernel/src/user/e1000e_service.rs`'s
  and `components/src/e1000e_transport.rs`'s BUGS.
- **Recorded.** `find_e1000e_device` is a second copy of `find_nvme_device` with a different
  predicate; a third (milestone 242 (USB host and a keyboard that is not a UART)'s xHCI) is where
  a shared helper is lifted. `kernel/src/pci.rs`, at the function.
- **Milestone 804.** Milestone 804 (the I219 reconfigures its PHY when link comes up). The I219's link-up reconfiguration, about 250 lines of FreeBSD, once the bench
  boot leases. `design/roadmap/804-the-i219-reconfigures-its-phy-when-link-comes-up.md`.
- **Recorded.** No third-party notices file ships with an image, which Intel's BSD license asks
  of binary redistribution. `crates/e1000e/src/pch/mod.rs`'s BUGS.
- **Recorded.** `disk_throughput`, the other bench feature, is linted by nothing. `script/lint`,
  beside the `network_bench` line.
