# 819. `jh7110_clock_and_reset`: JH7110 clock and reset logic, proven, then released on its own

*(Minted 2026-10-07 (UTC) by lane/publish-ours-milestones from calef's rulings on pull request
#1806. The number is provisional until the merge queue lands it; the title and slug are drafts.
The FAT crate's block in #1811 is the shape this follows.)*

calef's rulings, quoted from the maintainer comments on #1806 of 2026-10-07 (UTC):

- Policy: *"Each publish-ours crate (NVMe, e1000e, the DesignWare pair, the JH7110 pair, xHCI, and
  `portable_executable` once it carries proofs) is published when ready (proofs passing, API
  stable), each through its own milestone at its review."* His words: *"Since the consumer would be
  other hobby OSes, I think it makes sense to publish them. [...] a nice legacy is a bunch of hobby
  oses that use its parts."*
- Crates: *"one milestone per crate, minted now, each keeping its tree name (all free on crates.io
  as of today) [...] Names are ratified now and permanent on first publication."* His words: *"Yes,
  one per crate"*.
- Fork 4: *"the release workflow refuses to publish unless the proof job is green."* His word:
  *"Yes"*. The other release rules are forks 1 to 3 and 6, applied in *Release* below.

## What exists, checked 2026-10-07 (UTC)

- `crates/jh7110_clock_and_reset`: 863 code lines (1,577 with comments), written by milestone 220
  (this kernel drives no clock or reset controller, and the first real device will need one), which
  is BUILT. It holds the JH7110 clock and reset generator's register offsets and bit fields, the
  bring-up plans the TRNG, the SD slots and the PMIC's I2C bus need, and the device-tree queries
  that find the controllers.
- **No Kani harnesses and no falsification patches.** #1806's note counts it with the JH7110 pair as
  publish ours, but fork 4 refuses a release without green proofs. So this block starts by writing
  them, like milestone 821 (an ELF-to-PE converter, proven, then released on its own). The note's
  "publish with the DesignWare pair" also predates the one-milestone-per-crate ruling.
- Class B in #1806's note `notes/releasable-crates-2026-10-07.md`. **The cut** is codebase rule 2
  (a driver gets what it needs passed in). `discover`, `discover_aon`, `discover_sys` and
  `pmic_bus` take a `DeviceTreeBlob`. The caller passes the register regions and the bus's
  specifiers instead, and the queries move to the kernel side, which already depends on
  `device_tree_blob`.
- Its consumers, all in `kernel/src/`: `drivers/jh7110_clock_and_reset.rs` (the volatile shell),
  `designware_ethernet.rs`, `user/designware_mobile_storage_service.rs`, `user/entropy_service.rs`,
  `reboot.rs`, `memory.rs`, `lib.rs`, `storage_bench.rs` and `network_bench.rs`, plus
  `system_tests/src/user/entropy_tests.rs`.
- Two public functions here still carry provisional `Name:` blocks (`discover_sys`, after milestone
  53 (the board's own peripherals: network and storage on real silicon), and `pmic_bus`). The crate
  name is ratified; those are not, and their names become permanent with the crate.
- crates.io answers 404 for the name (checked 2026-10-07).

**Reuse:** the alternatives were surveyed in #1806's `survey.md` appendix (looked up 2026-10-07),
and none is taken, because calef ruled this crate "publish ours". The only Rust JH7110 crates found,
weathered-steel's `jh71xx-pac` 0.11.1 and `jh71xx-hal` 0.7.2 (Codeberg, 2025-03), are register maps
under GPL-3.0-only, which nife cannot take under its license. No Rust crate for the clock and reset
logic was found. Linux's `clk-starfive-jh7110-*` drivers stay the reference and are read, never
copied. No upstream offer goes anywhere: calef ruled on #1806 that nife contributes only to
projects nife depends on.

## What is proven

Kani harnesses, each with a falsification patch at
`crates/jh7110_clock_and_reset/falsifications/<module.path>.<harness>.patch` as §134 (a harness
carries a machine-replayable falsification record) and `script/falsifications` require:

1. `with_parent` changes only the mux field. For every word and every parent, every bit outside
   `CLOCK_MUX_MASK` is unchanged and an over-wide parent never spills into the enable bit.
2. Every offset a domain answers is one of its own words. For every clock id and reset id,
   `Domain::clock_offset` and `Domain::reset_bit` return none past the domain's `clocks` or
   `resets` count. Otherwise they return a word-aligned offset inside that domain's clock or reset
   range, so the shell can never be told to store outside the controller.
3. Every plan ungates its clocks before it releases its reset. The fixed plans and any plan built
   from caller-supplied specifiers hold only in-bounds ids, never more than `MAX_PMIC_BUS_STEPS`,
   with every `EnableClock` ahead of every `DeassertReset`.
4. The status decoders (`is_deasserted`, `is_clock_enabled`, `clock_divider`) are total and match
   their definitions for every word.

## Release, by #1806's rulings

1. Write the four proofs above with their falsification patches, then make the cut. `cargo tree -p
   jh7110_clock_and_reset` then lists no nife crate.
2. In the tree, `script/verify` proves the harnesses and `Cargo.toml` says `publish = false`.
3. The package is 0.1.0 with its own semver, states `rust-version` (#1806's note built it on stable
   1.94.1), and ships its harnesses and falsification patches. `cargo package --list` shows them.
4. Ready means proofs passing and the API stable. §235 (the OS is built and updated from
   packages, and the tree divides by what releases together) has milestone 610 (the interface's
   stability is measured weekly)'s per-package co-change column judges the second. When it is ready,
   calef adds it to the lint-checked publish allowlist. A `nifeos/jh7110_clock_and_reset` repository
   is then created on the shared CI template, through reusable workflows: Kani through
   `kani-github-action`, lint, release. Its release workflow refuses to publish unless the proof job
   is green. Nothing here reads `target_arch`, so stock Kani serves. The patched Kani of §218 (carry
   a Kani patch so riscv64 is proved, and send it upstream) is carried only if a harness comes to
   need riscv64. Milestone 589 (Kani can prove riscv64 from the hosts we already have) built it.
5. crates.io trusted publishing from that workflow, owned by a `nifeos` team, with no stored token.
6. calef approves this publication, as he does every one.
7. nife consumes the crates.io release, pinned with its checksum in `Cargo.lock`. A `[patch]` to a
   checkout is allowed only during development, and a lint fails one that reaches `main`. The copy
   under `crates/` goes.

## Parity

Pure logic, tested on the host. This lane built it on 2026-10-07 with the pinned nightly for
`aarch64-unknown-none-softfloat`, `riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf`, `x86_64-unknown-none` and the
host, all exit 0. The release workflow builds the same four. The silicon is riscv64 only; the crate
is not.

## Exit

A check proves it. `script/verify` proves the four properties and `script/falsifications` reports
every harness `replayable`. In nife, `cargo tree --locked -i jh7110_clock_and_reset` resolves to
`v0.1.x` from crates.io with a checksum in `Cargo.lock`, `crates/jh7110_clock_and_reset` no longer
exists, and the tree builds for all three targets. In `nifeos/jh7110_clock_and_reset`, the run that
published 0.1.0 shows the Kani job green ahead of the publish job.

## BUGS

- Steps 4 and 5 need machinery that does not exist yet: the publish allowlist lint, the shared CI
  template, the `nifeos` crates.io team, and milestone 610's per-package co-change column. #1806
  ruled their shape; none is a milestone yet.
- The four properties are this lane's proposal, read from the code, not a ruling. A lane writing
  them may find a better set and says so in its pull request.
- The device-tree fixtures (`tests/fixtures/*.dts`) are excerpts of the mainline and vendor JH7110
  trees. Their licenses were not checked here; record each before `cargo package` ships them.
- `needs_person` is `yes` because the exit includes a publication only calef can approve. Everything
  before step 6 can start now.

## Index row

nife's StarFive JH7110 clock and reset generator logic, which carries no proofs today, gains four
Kani proofs with falsification patches, is cut free of nife's device tree, and is published on
crates.io as `jh7110_clock_and_reset` 0.1 from its own `nifeos` repository.
