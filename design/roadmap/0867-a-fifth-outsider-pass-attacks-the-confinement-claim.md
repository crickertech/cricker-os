# 867. A fifth outsider pass attacks the confinement claim

*(Minted 2026-10-10 (UTC) by this lane as the maintainer's delegate, the way milestone 800 (a
non-Anthropic model attacks the confinement claim) was minted. The number 867 is provisional; other
lanes are minting nearby, so expect renumbering at merge. Title, slug and every name below are
drafts.)*

**Reuse:** the counting rule, the report format and the refusal log are milestone 800's, unchanged,
so the passes compare row for row. This pass is by Claude (Opus 5.5), so it serves criterion (c)'s
Anthropic half: it can be the first of the two consecutive clean passes, and the second must be a
non-Anthropic model or a human.

## Index row

The fifth outsider pass at risk 7's confinement claim, by Claude. It attacks the newest shipped
surfaces, the §255 (each socket is its own capability) socket-capability model first, counts an
attack only when it boots on three ISAs, and keeps the standing refusal log.

## Why

Risk 7 (the confinement claim is false) is AMBER. Its criterion (c) for green is two consecutive independent attacks with no escape on a shipped path, at least one by a non-Anthropic model or a human. A pass that leaves a refusal on a shipped path unexamined does not count (calef, "Add the
refusal log."). Pass 4 (milestone 800, GLM 5.3) booted the socket capture of milestone 649 (every client of a network stack shares its socket numbers). calef ruled it an escape on a shipped path, so the two-consecutive count is at zero. This pass can be the first of the two; the second must be
non-Anthropic or human.

## The attack

Informed, the posture milestone 800 set: the whole tree and its history are in hand, as any attacker
of a public repository has them. Variant analysis against each fixed escape, and new ground where
nothing has been found. The brief's targets were rows not attacked before, the newest surfaces and a refusal log. The surfaces: the §255 socket capabilities, std at the prompt, the §252 (a resolver grant is one zone per client badge) resolver grant, and the package fetch path of milestone 801 (packages over the internet) if it had merged.

## Result

See `notes/confinement-outsider-pass-5.md` for the full pass, the per-row table and the refusal log.

## Done means

- Every claim has an attack, or a written reason it was not attacked.
- Every escape is a failing test committed before any fix (none found this pass).
- The pass-5 note exists with its refusal log, and every finding has a home.
- Risk 7's appendix cites the pass through the maintainer under §216 (fatal-risk facts are
  correctable, and verdicts are the architect's). Moving the color stays calef's.

## Follow-on

- **Milestone 198.** A human review, or a public bounty once a stranger can install nife, is the
  stronger form and waits on milestone 198 (a package manager, and the trivial install that makes a
  second customer possible).
