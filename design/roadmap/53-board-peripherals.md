# 53. The board's own peripherals: network and storage on real silicon

The storage half is built for QEMU as of 2026-08-15 (pull request #193): the
`non_volatile_memory_express` crate (queue mechanics, host-tested, 5 Kani harnesses), a rule-2 kernel driver confined
through the IOMMU before enable, class-code enumeration over §18, and an end-to-end boot test on
both ISAs. The network half is built to the bench as of 2026-10-06 (below, "The network half").
What remains of the milestone: that half's first run on radon, the board-side
PLDA XpressRICH root complex that carries the NVMe driver to the real M.2 slot (now tracked as its
own milestone, 163, NOT-STARTED), and the EL0
question, which is §86 (PROPOSED). Scope and honest limits: notes/non-volatile-memory-express.md, BUGS included.

In the second sense: the board is here and this needs hands on it. Bringing up
an NVMe controller and a real NIC means flashing, a serial console, and power-cycling a board that
will wedge, none of which a background lane can do. Both halves of the *old* gate are gone. The hardware cleared 2026-08-14: the board
is on the desk and 16a boots it through the full tour, so the two drivers finally have silicon to
exist on. The storage fork was decided by calef on 2026-08-15: NVMe first, because the backup
workload (milestone 55) measures sustained sequential write and endurance, which SD media fails,
and because a real PCIe root-complex driver compounds into milestone 87's x86 machine where an
MSHC driver serves one slot on one board. SD/eMMC stays in scope as the later path, undecided only
in its ordering against the network driver.

In brief. Milestone 16a boots a VisionFive 2 (firmware contract, NS16550, PLIC, Sv39). It does not
give the board a network or a disk. Everything above needs both, and this is where virtio stops
carrying us: every driver we have talks to QEMU's paravirtual devices, and real silicon has none.

What it needs.

- Ethernet. The JH7110 uses a Synopsys DesignWare GMAC (`dwmac`). Our net_stack (smoltcp) is
  device-agnostic above the driver, so this is a driver, not a stack rewrite. Rule 2 applies: it takes
  a base address and knows nothing else.
- Storage, and there is a real choice here. The SD/eMMC controller is the simplest path; NVMe
  over PCIe is the better one, because §18's PCIe transport already exists and NVMe would give the
  backup target actual throughput. Deciding which comes first is a fork, and it should be decided on
  measurement of what the backup workload needs rather than on what is easiest.
- Persistence proven the hard way. RedoxFS on the real device, with crash consistency tested by
  **actually cutting power**, which is a test QEMU cannot run.

**The parity note this milestone must carry.** These drivers are board-specific and aarch64 has no
equivalent board yet, so rule 5's "a scope note records the gap and the plan" applies rather than its
"ships on every architecture". Say so explicitly; do not let it look like an oversight.

## The storage half on radon, 2026-10-06

calef, 2026-10-06 (UTC): radon is the most convenient lab machine, so move its hardware support
forward, and do not split this milestone. Built by lane/53-sdmmc, every name provisional.
notes/designware-mobile-storage.md has the evidence, the safety argument and the runbook.

- The part is a Synopsys DesignWare Mobile Storage Host Controller (`snps,dw-mshc` in the vendor
  tree radon hands over, `starfive,jh7110-mmc` in mainline): the microSD slot at `0x1602_0000`
  and the eMMC socket at `0x1601_0000`.
- `crates/designware_mobile_storage`: the whole driver behind one `Registers` trait, tested
  against a simulated controller and card (SDHC, SD 1.x, eMMC, an empty slot, CRC faults, an old
  release's FIFO, a short tail), four Kani harnesses with replayable falsifications.
  `crates/jh7110_clock_and_reset` gains both controllers' SYS clocks and resets.
- `kernel/src/storage_bench.rs`, behind `storage_bench`: identifies the card, reads its partition
  table, times an 8 MiB read, then reads it again through the EL0 block server. Read-only unless
  built with `NIFE_STORAGE_BENCH_WRITE=scratch`, and even then it writes only the sectors before
  the first partition, and restores them.
- `components/src/designware_mobile_storage.rs`: `filesystem_protocol::blk` at EL0 over one
  register page and a window of the card, the virtio and NVMe servers' shape. The booted system
  does not start it (`PROVEN_ON_SILICON`).
- The CPU moves every byte through the FIFO, so the first silicon read tests the controller and
  the card protocol without depending on radon's DMA coherence, which nobody has measured yet.
- Parity scope note (rule 5): the controller is the JH7110's, so the kernel half and the bench
  boot are riscv64-only, and `storage_bench` is a compile error elsewhere. The crate is
  architecture-neutral.
- Not run on silicon.

**Reuse:** OpenBSD's `dwmmc` (`sys/dev/fdt/dwmmc.c` 1.33, ISC), adapted with the notice carried in
the crate root; it matches both compatibles above. `starfive-jh7110-dwmmc` 0.1.8 on crates.io
(Apache-2.0) was read and refused as a dependency: 333 lines over `dwmmc-host` 0.4.2 (5,253 lines)
and three more crates from one young tree, with an IDMAC-only data path and volatile accesses inside
the driver core. Its JH7110 constants were a third cross-check. Linux's `dw_mmc`, U-Boot's driver
and both trees are GPL and were read for hardware facts only.

**Effort: not estimated.** Two device drivers against real hardware with no emulator to iterate
against is a different activity from everything done so far, and estimates calibrated on QEMU work do
not transfer.
## The network half, 2026-10-06

calef, 2026-10-06 (UTC): radon is the most convenient lab machine, so move its hardware support
forward, and do not split this milestone. Built by lane/53-gmac (pull request #1762), every name
provisional. notes/designware-ethernet.md has the split, the evidence and the runbook.

- `crates/designware_ethernet`: the controller (`snps,dwmac-5.20`) and its YT8531 PHY as
  host-tested logic, 47 tests against a simulated controller, two Kani harnesses with replayable
  falsifications. `crates/jh7110_clock_and_reset` gains the AON domain and `gmac0`'s plans.
- `kernel/src/designware_ethernet.rs` and `designware_ethernet_service.rs`, and a third NIC in
  `net_stack`, in milestone 494 (a driver for the network card a PC actually has)'s shape; the
  `network_bench` boot runs on radon over it.
- Is radon's DMA coherent? Every device tree and kernel policy read says yes (mainline's
  RISC-V default, `dma-noncoherent` absent from both JH7110 trees where the JH7100's tree has it);
  one Rust driver for the board flushes the L2 for its descriptors anyway, unexplained. The bring-up
  measures it before trusting a descriptor, with a loopback probe that tells the two directions of
  non-coherence apart. The proposal this makes to milestone 655 (DMA on a non-coherent RISC-V
  machine) is in the note.
- Parity scope note (rule 5). The driver is JH7110-specific and riscv64-only by design: no
  aarch64 or x86_64 machine nife runs on has this controller. The stack above it is shared by all
  three. A second board with a DesignWare QoS controller reuses the crate and needs only its glue.
- Not run on silicon. The booted system leaves the port alone until a bench boot passes
  (`PROVEN_ON_SILICON`).

**Reuse:** OpenBSD's `dwqe` and `ytphy` (ISC), adapted with the notice carried in the crate root,
because its JH7110 glue handles radon's v1.3B transmit clock (`starfive,tx-use-rgmii-clk`).
FreeBSD's `if_eqos_starfive.c` and `mcommphy.c` (BSD-2-Clause) also support this chip and were
read as an independent cross-check. Linux stmmac, U-Boot `dwc_eth_qos` and both JH7110 trees are
GPL and were read for hardware facts only. crates.io has one Rust driver for this board,
`dwmac-my` 0.2.0 (MIT, 3,650 lines). The search, on 2026-10-06, was for `dwmac`, `stmmac`,
`eqos`, `designware ethernet`, `jh7110` and `starfive`. It is refused as a dependency, for the
reasons 494 refused Redox's `e1000d`. It slices a receive buffer by the descriptor's length unchecked, up to 32 KiB against a
2 KiB buffer. It hard-codes the clock controllers' addresses (rule 2). It is one object, with no
place for the kernel/process split, and it would bring `bitflags` and `log`. It was read as a
third cross-check.

## Follow-on

- **Outstanding.** The network half's first run on radon: calef's bench step in
  notes/designware-ethernet.md, about ten minutes, nothing on the card changes. It answers the
  coherence question by measurement, and passing it lifts `PROVEN_ON_SILICON`.
- **Milestone 163.** The board-side PLDA XpressRICH root complex that would carry the NVMe driver
  to the real M.2 slot. Minted 2026-08-25, still NOT-STARTED on a HARDWARE gate.
- **Decision.** Whether the NVMe driver can leave the kernel is answered rather than pending:
  `design/decisions/86-el0-nvme-driver.md` is DECIDED as of 2026-09-03, option 2a now with option 4
  addable without reshaping the EL0 driver, and the choice between them settled by measurement. The
  block's own prose still reads as though the fork were open.
- **Outstanding.** RedoxFS crash consistency proven by actually cutting power on radon. Nothing can
  power-cycle the board: milestone 224 is NOT-STARTED on a DECISION gate, and its own measurements
  record zero replies from the plug on the subnet. Checked 2026-09-03.
- **Outstanding.** The storage half's first run on radon: calef's three-boot bench step in
  notes/designware-mobile-storage.md, read-only first, then the scratch write, then the ordinary
  image back. Passing it lifts the block server's `PROVEN_ON_SILICON`.
- **Outstanding.** An architect's call, owed a PROPOSED file under `design/decisions/` that this
  lane may not write: which part of radon's storage the booted system's block server serves, a
  fact whatever writes the card and the kernel must agree on. The options: a second
  partition on the microSD card, beside the FAT one U-Boot boots from; the eMMC socket, if step 1
  finds a module fitted; or NVMe, once milestone 163 (the PLDA root complex) exists. Not blocking
  until the bench step passes.
- **Outstanding.** The IDMAC data path, once the network half's coherence probe has read radon's
  DMA coherence (milestone 655 (DMA on a non-coherent RISC-V machine)); then high speed and an
  8-bit eMMC bus, measured against the polled rate step 1 prints.
- **Done.** The rule-5 parity note this block says it must carry is carried, in `notes/non-volatile-memory-express.md`
  under a heading naming this milestone, stating what ships on all three architectures and what is
  board-specific.
- **Recorded.** Half the reason NVMe was picked over SD is gone: milestone 55 is REMOVED as of
  2026-08-30, so the backup workload whose sustained sequential write decided the fork no longer
  exists. The root-complex-compounds-into-87 half of that argument survives; the measurement half
  has no customer, and `notes/non-volatile-memory-express.md` still cites 55's storage bench as the thing that will want
  real queue depth.
