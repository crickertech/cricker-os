# 784. Reuse what the tree wrote: which first-party code an existing library should replace

Written by the research lane `lane/reuse-audit` on 2026-10-04 (UTC) at base `7da1a9f29`. It answers
calef's question of the same day: under the §46 (thin primitives or whole subsystems) amendment,
*what that we already have in the tree would be a better candidate for reuse?* The ruling: outside the
kernel and the crates Kani proves, the default is to take or adapt existing code, and writing our own
needs a recorded reason. The amendment's text was still in flight as pull request #1637 (a claim
commit only), so the `Reuse:` lines below use the ruling's terms and should be conformed to the
landed wording. Title and slug are drafts.

This is a proposal, not a decision. Every replacement below adds a dependency, which §46 makes an
architect's call, so each milestone waits on its own ruling.

## Method, and what the numbers mean

- Inventory. All 91 crates under `crates/`, the 58 programs in `components/src/`, `uefi_loader`,
  `redoxfs_server`, `tools/redoxfs_host` and the host tools under `xtask`. Lines are code lines (blank and
  comment lines removed, test modules included), by script; Kani counts are `#[kani::proof]`s.
- Candidates. Each `.crate` was downloaded and its `Cargo.toml` and source read; downloads,
  license and release dates from the crates.io API, advisories from `rustsec/advisory-db`, both on
  2026-10-04. Anything else is marked *from memory*.
- License. Base (needed to boot, install or fetch a package) is permissive only, and so is
  anything linked into one of our programs, per §135 (running GPL software is aggregation). A whole
  GPL program running as its own process is allowed as an `optional` package. `deny.toml` today
  allows MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause, 0BSD and ISC, so an MPL-2.0 crate (`fdt`, `noline`,
  `serialport`) would need a license ruling first.

## The inventory, grouped by why it stays or goes

Kernel, or used by the kernel for more than shared constants, keep by default (rule 3 and the
amendment's exemption). The crates: `paging` (2,866 lines, 36 Kani), `capability`,
`inter_process_communication`, `machine_discovery` (5,714 lines, 16 Kani, ACPI included), `pci`,
`non_volatile_memory_express`, `direct_memory_access_validator`. Also `page_frames`, `generational_table`,
`address_space_identifier`, `intrusive_fifo`, the five loom-checked crates, the two JH7110 drivers,
`firmware_configuration`, `screen_console`, `compositor`, `measured_boot`, and the kernel's own
35,186 lines.

Kani-proved and outside the kernel, keep unless a proof is no longer worth having. The crates, with lines and Kani proofs: `calendar`
(1,089, 11), `timetable` (2,884, 10), `globally_unique_identifier_partition_table` (2,219, 9),
`elf` (1,173, 8, also kernel), `network_time_protocol` (684, 7). Also `glob` (650, 6), `component_plan`
(1,248, 5), `subtree_scope` (384, 5), `device_tree_blob` (1,814, 4, also kernel),
`credential_protocol` (322, 3), `filesystem_protocol` (2,636, 3), `package_archive` (677, 2),
`manifest_note` (607, 2), `nifefs` (354, 2).

The ABI, a capability, or one of the 19 `*_protocol` crates (rule 3). The crates: every `*_protocol` crate,
`abi`, `grant_plan` (6,405), `swish` (3,404 plus the 3,690-line program), `system_initializer`
(2,972), `supervision_protocol`, `swap_protocol`. Also `user_mode_runtime`, `system_log` (1,214), the
`procps` tools (`ps`, `pgrep`, `pmap`, `top`, `free`, `vmstat`, `slabtop`, `uptime`, about 1,700
together, all reading nife's own statistics ABI), `login`, `credentialer` (already takes `argon2`).

Not kernel, not proved, not protocol: the candidates. Surprise: the kernel lists
`video_terminal` and `line_editor` as dependencies, but reads only their wire constants
(`video_terminal::status`, `line_editor::proto`). Their engines are userspace code.

## Ranked: trust gained per cost

1. Adapt `http_response` to `httparse`. The package fetch path is rung 3a of milestone 198 (a package manager, and the trivial install that
makes a second customer possible). It parses a network peer's response head with about 70 lines of
our own, fuzzed (46 million inputs) but not
proved: the crate's own BUGS section records that a Kani harness did not finish. `httparse` is under
`hyper`, has no dependencies, builds `no_std`, and has had no advisory. Keep our request writer, the
2 KiB head cap, and our `Content-Length` policy (no close-delimited body); hand the head to
`httparse::Response::parse` and let its `Partial` status replace our `ends_with` scan. The existing
fuzz target keeps working unchanged. Cost: small, one lane-day *(estimate)*.
Loss: none proved; one zero-dependency crate in the base graph.

2. Adapt `video_terminal` to `vte` for parsing, keeping our grid. Every program that writes to a
terminal feeds this parser, so it is the widest untrusted-input surface in userspace that nothing
proves. Our parser has four states on purpose: "a VT's full state machine
has a dozen states". `vte` is that full machine (Paul Williams' DEC parser, *from memory* the one
Alacritty ships) behind a `Perform` trait our grid can implement. Cost: medium; the engine is 2,523
lines and the lane must measure how much of it is parser rather than grid before claiming a number.
Loss: none proved; two widely used crates (`arrayvec`, `memchr`) in the base graph.

3. Adapt the virtio drivers to `virtio-drivers`, one device per milestone. About 1,500 lines of
device-facing code, with no proofs, driven by bytes a device or a hostile hypervisor writes.
`virtio-drivers` covers block, net, GPU and input over MMIO and PCI ECAM, is active (last push
2026-09-25), and its leading contributor by commits is `qwandor` (488 commits) *(from memory: of
Google's Android virtualization work)*. Read, and the reason this is third rather than first:
its README and source do not negotiate `VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM`, which `virtio_net_transport.rs`
and `keyboard_driver.rs` accept today because they sit behind the IOMMU. So the first milestone is
an upstream patch, and the plan fails if upstream refuses it, leaving a fork. Its `Hal` trait is
static methods, so the DMA capability has to sit in a global. The kernel's DMA validation is
untouched. New base-graph crates: `zerocopy`, `safe-mmio`, `thiserror`, `enumn`, `log`, `bitflags`.
Measure throughput with `script/bench` before and after each device.

4. Measure `user_mode_heap` against `talc`, then decide. 272 lines of first-fit free list in every
process. `talc` is maintained (2026-09) and `no_std`. The prior art cuts both ways:
`linked_list_allocator`, the same algorithm as ours, had out-of-bounds writes (RUSTSEC-2022-0063),
which is the class of bug a hand-written heap carries. Measure first, per the tenet: allocation
latency and fragmentation on the `job_mix` workload, then rule. Retires little code; the case is exposure.

5. Replace `uefi_loader/src/efi.rs` with `r-efi`. 307 lines of hand-transcribed UEFI tables, whose
own header names the foot gun: "`BootServices`'s field order is the ABI ... getting the count of
unused ones wrong silently re-points every call after it." `r-efi` has no dependencies and is the
binding Rust's own UEFI targets use *(from memory; consistent with its 382M downloads and its
`rustc-dep-of-std` feature, which was read)*. The header's recorded reason was that `uefi` is "in
between"; `r-efi` is a thin primitive, which the old §46 already allowed. Cost: small.

6. Replace `stick_maker`'s `plist.rs` with `plist`. 335 lines retire from a host program people
run on macOS. The input is `diskutil` output, so the gain is modest. Adds `quick_xml`, `time`,
`base64`, `indexmap` and `serde` to that program, none in a nife image.

7. Survey `portable_executable` against `object` 0.40.0's `write::pe::Writer`. Host-only, no
untrusted input; up to 778 lines retire, unless the ELF-to-PE logic is ours by necessity.

8. Survey uutils for the `coreutils` package. MIT, so base-eligible. `ripgrep` already runs
unmodified (milestone 121 (`ripgrep` on nife)), which shows the `std` path works. Open: which `uu_*` build against the
PAL, and what `uucore`'s weight does to the base image. Few lines retire; the value is the demo.

9. Editor: `rmle` stays until one of two takes it. `kibi` (MIT/Apache, a Rust editor inspired by
the same `kilo` `rmle` is modelled on) needs `libc` termios and raw stdin, which the PAL does not
bind. GNU `nano` is the GPL-as-package path (milestone 170). `rmle` is `optional`, so either can
replace it without touching base.

9a. Adapt `mdr` to `pulldown-cmark`, as a std program. The first draft refused this for being
std-only, the wrong test (see the next section). `mdr` is a userspace reader of shipped
documentation; it holds a terminal and a directory, so it can be built against `nife-dev`. Read in
0.13.4: no `std::thread`, no runtime, three small dependencies, and the `html` and `getopts` defaults
can be turned off. Take the parser, keep our terminal renderer as its event consumer, and keep
`documentation::index`, which `swish` reads and which is ours by format. Retires up to the 802-line
renderer's parsing half; the gain is CommonMark conformance on input a package author writes. Cost:
small to medium, most of it moving `mdr` to std.

10. xHCI, when milestone 242 starts: adapt rust-osdev `xhci` for register and TRB definitions.
Write the driver logic; take the definitions. The crate is dormant (release 2023-07), so expect to
carry it as a fork or vendor it under §34 (RedoxFS is the primary filesystem, on three conditions)'s "we must patch it" trigger.

Not ranked: `board_console`'s `port.rs` could take `rustix` termios (host-only). DNS is surveyed
separately in pull request #1638.

## Needing std is not, by itself, a reason to refuse a crate

calef asked on 2026-10-04 (UTC) why std blocked reuse. It should not, for a component that runs as a
userspace program. nife has its own std port, the `nife-dev` toolchain with a nife PAL
(`notes/std.md`), with `std::fs` and `std::net` bound to granted capabilities and real `sleep` and
`yield`, and `ripgrep` runs on it unmodified. The real blockers are narrower, and a refusal must name
one of them:

- The component cannot take std: it is the kernel, the loader, or an early or base program built
  `no_std` that must stay so (the allocator, a driver at the bottom of the boot).
- The crate spawns threads. `thread::spawn` is `Unsupported`, declined for want of a customer by
  §105 (`std::thread::spawn` stays declined, until a customer needs it). Threads only in a test module do not count.
- The crate needs an async IO reactor. A tokio current-thread `block_on` links, but `mio`'s
  reactor needs a file descriptor and a poller, and the PAL has neither (`notes/crates-io-on-nife.md`).
- The crate needs OS APIs the PAL does not bind: processes, signals, `libc` termios, raw stdin,
  symlinks. `libc` has no `nife` module.

Rechecked under this rule, reading each crate's source for threads and runtimes:

| Crate | Serves | That component | Threads, async, OS APIs | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pulldown-cmark` 0.13.4 | `mdr` | `no_std` program, could be std | none | unblocked: candidate 9a |
| `fatfs` 0.3.6 | `installer` | base `no_std` program | none | std removes the `core_io` problem, but moving the installer to std is itself a milestone, and the crate has not released since 2023-01. Survey further |
| `kibi` 0.3.3 | `rmle` | `optional` program | no threads; needs `libc` termios and raw stdin | blocked on the PAL, not on std |
| `rustyline` 18.0.0 | `line_editor` | engine used by the terminal service | no threads; `libc` and `nix` termios | blocked on the PAL, and the engine sits under the console |
| uutils `uucore` 0.12.0 | `coreutils` | base programs, could be std | `std::thread` in test modules only; `libc` in its feature modules | unchanged: survey which `uu_*` build |
| `gptman` 3.1.1 | GPT | proved crate | not the issue | unchanged: kept for its 9 Kani harnesses |
| hickory-resolver 0.26.3 | DNS, milestone 384 (in a capability system the resolver is a grant) | its own program | tokio's reactor | blocked by the reactor, not by std; said on pull request #1638 |

## Running another OS's drivers unmodified

calef asked that this path be noted. Read for this proposal:

- NetBSD rump kernels run NetBSD drivers unmodified in userspace, including on L4 through Genode
  (Wikipedia, "Rump kernel"). The `rumpkernel/rumprun` repository was last pushed 2020-05-11 and lists
  x86 and ARM, not aarch64 or riscv64; a platform supplies the `rumpuser` hypercall interface. NetBSD
  source is BSD-licensed *(from memory)*, so rump-hosted drivers could be base.
- DDE / DDEKit (TU Dresden) maps the in-kernel Linux driver interface onto a host system so Linux
  drivers run unmodified in userspace, originally on L4. Genode's release notes show `dde_linux` kept
  current, to Linux 6.18 in 26.02. Those drivers are GPL, so under §135 they can be packages only:
  acceptable for, say, a Wi-Fi card an installed system adds, never for a boot or install driver.

Either means a C toolchain and a large shim. Survey further only when a driver nobody has in Rust is
on the customer path.

## The seven questions, for the top five

1. Considered and lost. `uefi` lost to `r-efi` (`uefi` is 23k lines, ours needs the bindings
   only). `fatfs` waits because `installer` is `no_std` and the crate has not released since
   2023-01. `pulldown-cmark` no longer loses: needing std was the wrong test. `noline`, `fdt` and `serialport` lost on
   license (MPL-2.0, not in `deny.toml`). `goblin` and `xmas-elf` lost to our Kani-proved `elf`
   (`xmas-elf` has RUSTSEC-2025-0018, an out-of-bounds read on a malformed ELF).
2. What the tree already does. `smoltcp` is taken whole and unpatched, and argon2 and RustCrypto
   are ordinary dependencies; `httparse`, `vte` and `r-efi` fit that shape. `virtio-drivers` needs a
   patch, which is RedoxFS's shape (§34).
3. Prior art. In the tables above.
4. Is the premise true? Mostly. The surprise is that the kernel's dependency on `video_terminal`
   and `line_editor` is constants only, so the kernel exemption does not cover their engines.
5. Cost. Lines retired are measured above; lane time is estimated. Throughput and heap numbers are
   owed by candidates 3 and 4 before any ruling.
6. Reversibility. Each replacement is reversible code; adding a crate to the base graph is §46's
   expensive category, and nobody has acted yet.
7. Same cost? Yes for 1, 2, 5 and 6: with equal effort, the exposed library wins on trust. 3 is
   closer, because the fork risk is real. Nothing here is recommended because it is less work.

## Proposed milestones, one replacement each

- (a) `http_response` parses its head with `httparse`. Gate: existing host tests and fuzz target.
- (b) `video_terminal` parses with `vte`; the grid stays. Gate: existing host tests, plus a fuzz
  target the crate does not have.
- (c0) Upstream `VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM` to `virtio-drivers`. Then (c1) input, (c2) GPU,
  (c3) block, (c4) net, each with a `script/bench` number before and after, on all three
  architectures.
- (d) Measure `user_mode_heap` against `talc`; the ruling follows the data.
- (e) `uefi_loader` binds UEFI through `r-efi`.
- (f) `stick_maker` reads `diskutil` through `plist`.
- (f2) `mdr` becomes a std program and parses with `pulldown-cmark`; the renderer and index stay.
- Surveys: (g) `portable_executable` and `object`; (h) uutils for `coreutils`.

## Recorded reasons for what stays

Each component that stays has a `Reuse:` line ready to paste, to be conformed to the amendment's
landed wording: [recorded-reasons.md](784-reuse-what-the-tree-wrote/recorded-reasons.md).

## One question for an architect, outside the default

`measured_boot` hand-writes SHA-256 (about a hundred lines, by its own header) while `sha2` is already
an ordinary dependency of `cryptography_provider`. Rule 3 (kernel) says write; rule 4 (crypto) says
take. The header's reason, a small trusted computing base checked against FIPS 180-4 vectors, is a
real one, and the kernel is exempt from the new default, so this proposal does not recommend a change.
It records that two rules of §46 disagree here and only an architect can say which wins.

## Index row

Under the 2026-10-04 amendment to §46, taking existing code is the default outside the kernel and the crates Kani proves. This survey names which first-party code an existing library should replace, with measured candidates, licenses and advisories, and each replacement waits on its own dependency ruling.
