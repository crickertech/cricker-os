# 879. The kernel's file-service wiring is split along its seams

*(Minted 2026-10-11 (UTC) by lane split-milestones-2, filed at calef's approval the same day; number
provisional until the merge queue lands it. Title and slug are drafts.)*

`kernel/src/user/fs_service.rs` is 2,258 lines at `396187b0b`. §266 (a Rust source file stays
under 2,000 lines) sets the ceiling. Milestone 840 (the scheduler file is split along its seams)
is the model for this block.

Its row in `design/file-length-baseline.tsv` still says 2,407. The file shrank twice in two days
without the row being banked, which §266's ratchet allows. Milestone 835 (a C library, stage 1:
files, clock and memory) moved the shared `std` spawn into `fs_service/std_spawn.rs` (2,407 to
2,343). Milestone 809 (the package client becomes a program) moved `install_for_test` into
`fs_service/test_install.rs` (2,343 to 2,258). Each carved off just enough to pass the ratchet,
and the next feature here will hit the same wall.

The file is a child module of `kernel/src/user.rs`, which milestone 872 (the kernel's user-mode
file is split along its seams) covers. The two are independent, with the two caveats under "What
moving the code breaks".

The cut and every module name below are calef's call. A lane writes them up as a
`status: PROPOSED` file in `design/decisions/` before it moves a line, and its pull request
carries `needs-architect`.

Reuse: not applicable; this moves code and adds none. The precedent is in this file's own
directory: `std_spawn` and `test_install` are the two child modules already split out of it.

## What is in the file

Measured on `396187b0b` from the file's own top-level items. Ranges are approximate at the edges,
where a doc comment belongs to the item below it.

| lines | count | what |
|---|---|---|
| 1 to 656 | 656 | constants, the file and block channels, stack poisoning, client windows, `ensure`, `wire_servers`, the NVMe arm, `spawn_block_server`, `spawn_fs_server` |
| 657 to 797 | 141 | the crash test's own service on its own disk: `CrashRun`, `start_crash`, `recover_crash` |
| 798 to 893 | 96 | `spawn_fs_client` and `start` |
| 894 to 928 | 35 | `Grant`, the per-file grant's value |
| 929 to 988 | 60 | `wait_for_service`, `wait_for_caretaker` |
| 989 to 1096 | 108 | `start_granted`, `DirGrant` |
| 1097 to 1165 | 69 | the server, `mkfs` and block-driver images, and their refusal sentences |
| 1166 to 1188 | 23 | `root_directory`, the one entry point the interactive boot uses |
| 1189 to 1348 | 160 | `narrow_dir`, `narrow_dir_held`, `spawn_caretaker`, `start_granted_dir` |
| 1349 to 1475 | 127 | the set grant: `SetGrant`, `start_granted_set` |
| 1476 to 1588 | 113 | the shared-frame witness, two live clients on one service |
| 1589 to 1686 | 98 | the file sink and the file source |
| 1687 to 2010 | 324 | every `start_std*`, `NarrowedStd`, `BoundStd`, `bind_subtree`, the `std_spawn` declaration |
| 2011 to 2145 | 135 | two directory grants to one process |
| 2146 to 2258 | 113 | the root-file helpers tests use, and the `test_install` declaration |

There are no tests in the file: no `#[test]` or `#[test_case]` and no `mod tests`. The tests that
drive it live in 21 files under `system_tests/src/user/`. Of the file's items, 35 carry
`allow(dead_code)` outside `test` and `system_tests`. They are rigs only the suite calls.

## The verdict: split by feature; there are no tests to move

The tests-only axis of milestone 846 (the file-server core moves its tests out) is not available.
The question is only which features leave.

Each block in the table after line 656 is a rig with its own helpers, built by one milestone. The
crash service, the caretaker grants, the `std` spawns, the sink, the witness: each takes the
service from `ensure` and adds one shape of client. That is a by-feature seam, and every one of
them can be a child module that keeps reaching the parent's private statics. Nothing widens.

What stays is the service itself: the channels, the windows, the two servers, the client spawn,
the readiness drain and the images. That is also the part milestone 811 (the boot services leave
the kernel: the kernel starts only the progenitor) moves out of the kernel. It leaves the test-only
rigs where they are. After this split, 811 takes most of the parent and touches no child.

The smaller step is to move the 324 lines of `std` spawns into `std_spawn.rs` and stop. That
leaves the file at about 1,934, under the ceiling by 66 lines. Two lanes in a row already did the
smallest step here, so this block recommends the full cut once.

## A proposed cut

Every name here is provisional. The new modules are private, and `fs_service.rs` re-exports their
`pub` items, so every `kernel::user::fs_service::` path in use today still resolves.

| module, provisional | from the table | about |
|---|---|---|
| `fs_service` (`fs_service.rs`) | 1 to 656, 798 to 893, 929 to 988, 1097 to 1188, re-exports | 950 |
| `fs_service::crash` | 657 to 797 | 140 |
| `fs_service::grant` | 894 to 928, 989 to 1096, 1189 to 1475, 2011 to 2145 | 570 |
| `fs_service::std_spawn` (exists, 128) | 1687 to 2010 | 450 |
| `fs_service::shared_frame_witness` | 1476 to 1588 | 115 |
| `fs_service::file_sink` | 1589 to 1686 | 100 |
| `fs_service::test_install` (exists, 98) | 2146 to 2258 | 210 |

The parent ends near 950 lines, far under 840's standard of 3,000, and no new file passes 1,500.
`spawn_caretaker` has callers only in `grant`, so it moves there and stays private. The `std`
spawns call `narrow_dir_held`, which is `pub` and resolves through the parent's re-export.

## What an architect has to rule

1. The full cut, or only the `std` move. The recommendation is the full cut. The smaller step
   leaves 66 lines of headroom in a file that grew 2,132 to 2,407 between 2026-09-27 and
   2026-10-07. That reason is about how soon the work recurs, which is close to an effort
   argument; at equal cost the full cut still wins because it matches 811's seam.
2. Private modules with re-exports, or public modules. The recommendation is private: 35 Rust
   files in `kernel` and `system_tests` use `fs_service::` paths, and none of them changes. Public modules would
   add a second path to every item. That reason holds at equal cost.
3. Whether the 100-line witness and sink modules stand alone or join another. The recommendation is
   alone, since each is one milestone's rig with nothing shared.
4. Every module name in the table.

No public crate API, wire format or syscall changes under any answer here.

## What it is not

A file split, not a gating change. Gating the test-only modules behind `cfg(feature =
"system_tests")` would drop code from the production build. That changes what ships and is not
this milestone.

## What moving the code breaks

Found with `grep` at `396187b0b`. A lane has to carry each one.

- No falsification patch under `kernel/falsifications/`, `system_tests/falsifications/` or any
  other `falsifications` directory diffs this file. One,
  `user.spawn_mapping_revocation_tests.a_page_the_kernel_wired_is_unmapped_when_its_frame_is_revoked.patch`,
  names `fs_service::spawn_fs_server` in its prose and diffs `revoke.rs` and `user.rs`. Those file
  names carry a test's module path, but no test lives here, so none is renamed.
- No Kani harness is in this file, and nothing in `.github/` names it.
- `script/fastpath-footprint` matches mangled names under `kernel5sched` and `kernel7syscall` only.
  `script/stack-frame-check` lists no `kernel::user::fs_service` symbol. A moved function's
  symbol path changes, and neither tool keys on any of them.
- `helpers/cap_abbreviation.py` has no allowance keyed on this path.
- `design/file-length-baseline.tsv` row 27 must be removed in the same change. It sits next to
  `kernel/src/user.rs`'s row 26, which milestone 872 removes or lowers. If both pull requests are
  open at once, the second to merge rebases over a one-line conflict.
- `fs_service.rs` opens with `use super::*`, so it sees whatever `user.rs` names. If milestone 872
  moves an item this file uses into a private module of `user` without re-exporting it, this file
  stops compiling. That is 872's to keep working; this split adds no new reach into `user`.
- Seven lines in five files cite `fs_service.rs:NNNN`. The two in
  `design/roadmap/0811-boot-services-leave-the-kernel.md` and the ones in milestones 292 and 849
  are best replaced with function names. Those in the dated audit report and in
  `notes/swish-check-flake.md` describe the file as it was and stay.
- 28 tracked files outside this block name the path. `notes/fs-server.md` and
  `notes/dir-capability.md` point a reader at items that will move.
- `helpers/qemu-runner-aarch64.sh` and `helpers/qemu-runner-x86_64.sh` name the file in comments,
  and `fs_service::wire_servers` stays in the parent.
- 8 first-parent merges in the 14 days to 2026-10-11 touched it. That is cool enough to take any
  time.

Pull request #1892 (milestone 812 (`std::thread::spawn` runs real threads in one address space))
does not touch this file at its current head, but if it changes the file before it merges, every
line range above must be re-measured.

## Done when

1. `kernel/src/user/fs_service.rs` is under 1,500 lines, and no new file is over 1,500.
2. No Rust file outside `kernel/src/user/fs_service.rs` and `kernel/src/user/fs_service/` changes,
   and no item's visibility widens.
3. `script/test` passes on aarch64, riscv64 and x86_64 with no test body changed.
4. The row for this file is gone from `design/file-length-baseline.tsv`.
5. The citations listed above that are kept current name a function, not a line.
6. Each new module carries a `//! Name:` block marked provisional.

## Index row

`kernel/src/user/fs_service.rs` is 2,258 lines and has twice shed just enough to pass §266's
ratchet. It holds the file service and a dozen test rigs built on it, and no tests of its own.
This moves each rig into a private child module beside the two already split out, leaving the
service itself at about 950 lines. The cut and every name are an architect's call.
