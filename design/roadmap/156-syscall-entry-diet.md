# 156. `syscall_entry`'s measured size is every method combined; extract the rest and ratchet both ways

Built 2026-08-23. Minted 2026-08-23, found while fixing milestone 126's `pmap` (`abi::aspace::LIST`
tripped `script/fastpath-footprint`'s 5% bound, +6.7% on riscv64). Extracting `LIST` alone into an
`#[inline(never)]` function fixed that one regression; measuring why turned up a bigger, pre-existing
gap this milestone tracks. Scope widened 2026-08-23 (calef, answering "do we have a mechanism to
ratchet down our performance benchmark" with "add it to milestone 156's scope"): the gate itself has
the same one-directional problem the extraction work is about to make concrete, and both belong in
one milestone since the second is what makes the first's gains actually stick.

## What was built

Both parts landed. Part one: `Untyped::{MAP,RETYPE_OBJ,RETYPE,SPLIT,DESTROY}`, `Frame::{MAP,REVOKE}`,
`Tcb::{CONFIGURE,CAP_INSERT}`, `Irq::{WAIT,ACK}`, `Virtio`'s four register methods, and
`Endpoint::REAP` all moved into `#[inline(never)]` functions, the same shape as `LIST`'s own fix.
`DeviceFrame::REVOKE` and `Tcb::START` were tried and reverted: the byte delta was negligible and not
worth carrying the diff. `Endpoint::{SEND,RECV,CALL}` and `Reply::REPLY`, the genuine IPC round trip,
stayed inlined on purpose. Part two: `script/fastpath-footprint`'s comparison now fails symmetrically
on `abs(delta) > TOL` in either direction, requiring `--save` to acknowledge a shrink exactly as it
already required one to justify growth.

**A correction found during landing, not during the lane's own work**: the lane's final merge of
`origin/main` (its own recorded commit) silently dropped `abi::aspace::LIST`'s match arm and its
`aspace_list` function during conflict resolution, which made its own `--save` measurement
(`syscall_entry` 1988 riscv64 / 3444 aarch64) look better than reality -- both numbers were measured
on a build missing a real, shipped feature. Restoring `aspace_list` during a later merge brought the
true, feature-complete numbers to 2210 / 3480: still a genuine 24% (riscv64) and 16.5% (aarch64)
reduction from `main`'s actual pre-156 baseline (2914 / 4168), just not as large as the invalid
figures the lost merge had produced. `bench/fastpath-{aarch64,riscv64}.txt` reflect the corrected,
verified numbers.

## The second finding: the gate only ratchets in one direction

Checked directly, `script/fastpath-footprint`'s own comparison:

```python
delta = (got - ref) / ref
if delta > TOL:            # only fires on growth past +5%
    ... fail ...
elif abs(delta) > 0.001:
    print(f"    {key}: {delta*100:+.1f}% against baseline ({ref}), within bound")
```

A shrink never fails and never blocks. `--save` re-records the baseline, but nothing prompts anyone
to run it after an improvement, so a real gain (this milestone's own extraction work, worth
hundreds of bytes) can land and sit unclaimed as slack in the recorded baseline indefinitely --
exactly the "somebody remembers" failure mode AGENTS.md's ladder names as rung zero. Worse than
cosmetic: a stale-loose baseline silently widens the tripwire's real tolerance. If `syscall_entry`
shrinks 20% and nobody re-saves, a later regression of +15% against the *current* code is actually
+15% against a number 20% too generous, and the gate still says "within bound."

**The fix is symmetry, not a new mechanism**: treat a shrink past the same 5% tolerance as an
equally reportable event as growth, requiring the same `--save` acknowledgment (unlike growth, a
shrink needs no justification for *why*, just an explicit commit that locks in the tighter number,
so the baseline never drifts stale by more than one tolerance band in either direction).

## The finding

`kernel/src/syscall::invoke` -- the giant `match cap.object { ... match method { ... } }` handling
every capability method this kernel has -- has **no separate symbol in the compiled binary**.
Checked directly: `llvm-objdump` on `target/riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf/release/kernel` finds no
`invoke` symbol at all, only `dispatch`, at roughly 663 instructions (~3 KiB). The compiler folds
`invoke` wholesale into `dispatch`, because `dispatch` is `invoke`'s only call site and nothing marks
either `#[inline(never)]`.

`script/fastpath-footprint` measures `dispatch` **flat, with no closure** (its own header comment:
"a syscall traverses one path through the decoder, but the decoder's own bytes are on every syscall,
and its other arms are not on this path at all" -- the intent already states the property this
milestone restores). Because `invoke` is inlined, every method arm's compiled bytes count against
that flat measurement today, hot or not: `Untyped::SPLIT`/`DESTROY`/`RETYPE_OBJ` (133 source lines),
`Irq::bind`/`enable` (144 lines), `Frame::MAP` (63 lines), `Aspace::MAP_INTO`/`CONFIGURE` and the
rest, none of which run on an IPC round trip.

`Endpoint::SURVEY` (milestone 126's first stratum) never tripped this by accident, not by design: it
is two lines, one call into `sched::survey_supervised`, small enough nobody noticed the shared
problem. `abi::aspace::LIST` was the first arm big enough (a loop, two function calls) to cross the
5% line on its own commit. Every arm before it has been contributing bytes to a number labelled "the
IPC fastpath" the whole time, individually below threshold, collectively real.

## What this milestone does, part one: the extraction

Apply the extraction already proven on `LIST` (`kernel/src/syscall.rs`'s `aspace_list`, milestone
126) to every other administrative method arm still inlined in `invoke`: pull the body into its own
`#[inline(never)] fn`, called from the match arm, leaving only the arm's rights check and the call
site in `invoke` itself. Candidates, by source-line weight (measured 2026-08-23, before milestone
126 lands; re-measure after, since `LIST`'s own extraction changes this table):

| arm | lines | verbs |
|---|---|---|
| `Object::Endpoint` | 150 | `SEND`, `RECV`, `CALL` (**leave inlined -- this is the actual fastpath**), `SURVEY` (already a thin call, leave), `REAP` |
| `Object::Irq` | 144 | `bind`, `enable`, and whatever else this arm covers -- read before assuming |
| `Object::Untyped` | 133 | `SPLIT`, `DESTROY`, `RETYPE_OBJ` |
| `Object::Frame` | 63 | `MAP` |
| `Object::Tcb` | 57 | `CONFIGURE`, `START`, and others -- read before assuming |
| `Object::DeviceFrame` | 19 | probably too small to matter; measure before spending effort |
| `Object::Virtio` | 23 | same caveat |

**`Endpoint::SEND`/`RECV`/`CALL` and `Reply::REPLY` stay inlined.** They are the actual IPC round
trip this gate exists to protect; extracting them would defeat the milestone's own purpose. Read
each arm's real content before deciding it is a candidate -- the table above is source-line count,
not a verdict, and `Endpoint`'s 150 lines mix the fastpath in with `SURVEY`/`REAP`, which do not
belong in the hot measurement either.

## What this milestone does, part two: symmetric ratcheting

In `script/fastpath-footprint`'s Python comparison, change the one-sided `if delta > TOL: fail` into
a check on `abs(delta) > TOL` for both directions, with distinct messages: growth keeps its existing
"shrink it, or re-record with --save and say why"; a shrink past tolerance prints "this is smaller
than the recorded baseline by more than the tolerance band -- re-record with --save to lock in the
tighter bound" and also fails, on the same reasoning growth does: an inaccurate baseline in
either direction is a gate that is no longer measuring what it claims to. No `--save`-side change
needed; the flag already does the right thing once something calls it.

## Verification, the same shape as `LIST`'s fix

Per arm extracted: `script/fastpath-footprint` before and after, on both `aarch64` and `riscv64`,
confirming the number drops and nothing else regresses. `script/lint` and the full `script/test`
suite after all extractions, since this touches the kernel's syscall boundary. **Do not `--save` a
new baseline until every planned extraction is done and measured together** -- saving mid-milestone
would bake in a smaller-but-still-inflated number and hide how much headroom the full extraction
actually recovers. Once the symmetric check is in place and every extraction is measured, the final
`--save` is what the new check itself will now require rather than merely suggest.

## What this does not decide

Whether `Endpoint`'s `REAP` (and any other genuinely-cold arm inside the 150-line block) is worth
extracting on its own is a judgment call for whoever builds this, guided by the measured delta each
extraction actually buys -- not every rare arm is large enough to be worth the diff. The exact
tolerance for the shrink-side check (whether it should match growth's 5% exactly, or use a wider
band to avoid nagging on noise) is also left to measurement: check how much run-to-run variance the
un-padded build actually has before picking a number narrower than what the data supports.

## Prior art

None needed outside this tree: `LIST`'s own fix (milestone 126, `kernel/src/syscall.rs`'s
`aspace_list`) is the pattern, already proven to work and already reviewed.

## Follow-on

- **Refused.** Extracting `DeviceFrame::REVOKE` and `Tcb::START`. Both were tried and reverted: the
  byte delta was negligible and not worth carrying the diff, which is the judgment call the "what
  this does not decide" section left to whoever built it.
- **Refused.** Extracting `Endpoint::SEND`, `RECV` and `CALL` or `Reply::REPLY`. They are the IPC
  round trip the footprint gate exists to protect, so pulling them out of `invoke` would improve the
  measured number by moving the thing being measured.
- **Refused.** A shrink-side tolerance narrower than growth's 5%. The symmetric check reuses the
  same band, because nothing has measured the un-padded build's run-to-run variance and a number
  tighter than the data supports produces a gate that nags rather than one that measures.
- **Recorded.** `design/roadmap/156-syscall-entry-diet.md` records the correction found during
  landing: a lane's own merge silently dropped `abi::aspace::LIST`'s match arm during conflict
  resolution, so its `--save` measurement was taken on a build missing a shipped feature and looked
  better than reality. The corrected numbers are in `bench/fastpath-aarch64.txt` and its riscv64
  sibling.

## Index row

`invoke` has no separate symbol in the compiled binary; the compiler folds it wholesale into `dispatch`, so `script/fastpath-footprint`'s flat measurement has been counting every capability
method's bytes, not just the IPC round trip, since before milestone 126's `pmap` tripped it.
Extract the rest of the rare administrative arms into `#[inline(never)]` functions, the pattern
already proven on `abi::aspace::LIST`; and fix the gate's own one-sided check so a genuine
improvement is required to tighten the baseline, not just permitted to.
