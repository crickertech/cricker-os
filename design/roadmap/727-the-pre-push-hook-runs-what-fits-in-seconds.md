# 727. The pre-push hook runs what fits in seconds

Raised 2026-10-03 (UTC). The number is provisional until the merge queue lands it; the title and
slug are drafts, and every new name below is provisional.

## Why

Milestone 630 (a merge-queue ejection is caught before the queue, and recovered after it) made the
pre-push hook all of `script/lint`. On 2026-10-03 that cost 70 to 120 s warm and 202 s cold on a
loaded machine, a claim push sat in it for a whole lane, and it refused five claim pushes.
The roadmap block they lacked cannot exist yet. Lanes took to `--no-verify`. calef approved the narrower
decision on #1564 (2026-10-03 UTC): "Approve the revised decision 3."

## Built

1. `script/lint --no-cargo` runs every lint section that does not invoke cargo. The partition is
   read out of `script/lint` by `helpers/lint-no-cargo.awk`, so a new check lands in one bucket
   when it is written. 46 of 65 sections run. A section that opts in with a marker, as counted
   claims does for its harness-count cross-check, must also guard on `$LINT_NO_CARGO`.
   `helpers/lint-no-cargo-selftest.sh` proves the rule and runs inside lint.
2. `.githooks/pre-push` runs `script/fmt --check`, then `script/lint --no-cargo`, then
   `--ready-branch`, and skips all three for a push that changes no files, so a claim push is no
   longer refused for a missing roadmap block. `--no-verify` stays documented as legitimate.
3. Measured on patagonia at a load average of 15 to 17: `script/lint --no-cargo` took 41.6, 47.2
   and 44.7 s on a warm tree, and fmt plus lint 43.0 s with no `target/` directory. The proposal's
   estimate of about 33 s was low. The numbers are in `notes/queue-ejection.md`.

## BUGS

- Clippy and the checks that call `cargo metadata` wait for CI. The `cargo metadata` ones are fast
  and could run here; the rule is "does not invoke cargo" because that is what calef approved.

## Index row

The pre-push hook runs `script/fmt --check`, then every lint check that does not invoke cargo
(`script/lint --no-cargo`), then the ready-status check, and skips all of it for a push that changes
no files.
