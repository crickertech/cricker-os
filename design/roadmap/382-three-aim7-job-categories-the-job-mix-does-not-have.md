# 382. Three of AIM7's job categories are missing from the multi-tasking workload

Built 2026-09-19, by milestone 168's own lane, in a different session and on the same
day this block was numbered. Two of the three categories landed: the job mix gained page mapping
and process creation, which are the two the argument below actually rested on. The third, the
disk-file category, is deliberately still absent and has its own proposal; see `## Follow-on`.

**The work and the number were minted by two sessions that could not see each other.** This branch
promoted the proposal to a numbered block while that lane was absorbing its content into milestone
168 and deleting the file. calef's ruling from milestone 433 decides which survives: a proposal is
promoted and then closed, because **a numbered block marked BUILT is a record and a deleted file is
nothing**. So the number stays, the status moves, and milestone 168 cites the block rather than a
path that no longer exists. Filed 2026-09-04 as an unnumbered proposal by milestone 168's lane, from
`crates/job_mix`'s own `BUGS`; numbered 2026-09-19 by milestone 433's drain. *(Number provisional
until the merge queue lands it.)*

It carried `Gate: NONE` for the design, with the *result* it improves still behind milestone 168's `HARDWARE`. The line is gone because a finished block's gate can only be stale. The
jobs themselves are ordinary userspace work and develop under QEMU.

In brief. `crates/job_mix` keeps AIM7's four methodological properties and stands in for its
categories with five jobs: a compute grind, a working-set walk, a null syscall, a yield burst and an
IPC round trip. **Three AIM7 categories have no representative**, each refused for a stated reason
rather than overlooked:

| category | why it is absent |
|---|---|
| disk-file operations | needs a disk attached, which would make the instrument's availability depend on the runner's storage; the same reason `script/bench`'s `fs_*` rows are not in the gated set |
| process creation | costs an address space per iteration, and `spawn_el0` exists to reclaim exactly one at a time; at 32 concurrent tasks it would measure the memory-region allocator rather than the scheduler |
| user page mapping | needs a per-task address-space capability the spawn path does not currently hand out |

## Why it matters

DECISIONS §96's question is how much of this kernel's time goes into process-kernel overhead under
multi-tasking load, and the cost lives in kernel stacks left behind by threads that block inside
the kernel. Two of the three missing categories are exactly that: a filesystem call and a spawn
both block deep in a kernel path, where a null syscall and a yield do not. So the missing categories
are not a fidelity nicety; they are plausibly where the effect is largest, and a flat result from the
present mix is weaker evidence than a flat result from a mix that had them.

## What it would take

The map job is the cheapest and should go first: it needs the spawn path to hand a task a capability
on its own address space, or a shared target space the way `kernel/src/bench.rs`'s `map_el0` already
builds one. The spawn job wants the reclaim `spawn_el0` already does, done per task rather than per
supervisor. The file job wants the sweep to run with a disk attached and should probably be a second
mix rather than an addition to the first, so a run without a disk is still a comparable run.

## What is blocked until it is answered

Nothing. Milestone 168's instrument works and its result is interpretable, with this limitation named
in `crates/job_mix`'s `BUGS` and in `notes/job-mix.md` where a reader meets the number. What is at
stake is how much weight a flat curve can carry.

## Follow-on

- **Milestone 168.** Where the work landed: *"The second hole"* and *"What changed on 2026-09-19"*
  in that block, with the refusals this one recorded answered there. The map job did not need a new
  capability, and the spawn job's allocator share is now printed.
- **Milestone 493.** The disk-file category, which is the one of the three that did not land and is
  not simply deferred. A 2026-09-13 correction to `crates/job_mix`'s `BUGS` established that
  Warton's own AIM7 run had the filesystem jobs disabled (section 5.4, the ramdisk was too
  small), so the gap is not a gap against the number this crate exists to chase. Its own proposal is
  milestone 493 (a disk-file job mix needs a disk), `design/roadmap/493-a-disk-file-job-mix-needs-a-disk-radon-can-drive.md`, which names the
  harder half: a disk radon can actually drive.
- **Recorded.** *No seven-job sweep has run on silicon.* Every claim about the new instrument is a
  resampling of the old one's data, and the map and spawn jobs may change `tasks=4`'s distribution.
  Recorded in milestone 168's `BUGS`, where a reader meets the instrument.

## Index row

`crates/job_mix` keeps AIM7's four methodological properties and stands in for its categories with
five jobs: a compute grind, a working-set walk, a null syscall, a yield burst and an IPC round trip.
Three AIM7 categories have no representative, each refused for a stated reason rather than
overlooked: a disk-file job would make the instrument's availability depend on the runner's storage,
a process-creation job would measure the memory-region allocator rather than the scheduler at 32
concurrent tasks, and a page-mapping job needs a per-task address-space capability the spawn path
does not hand out. Two of the three are exactly where DECISIONS §96's effect should be largest,
because a filesystem call and a spawn both block deep in a kernel path where a null syscall and a
yield do not, so a flat curve from the present mix is weaker evidence than a flat curve from a mix
that had them. The map job is the cheapest and goes first; the spawn job wants `spawn_el0`'s reclaim
done per task; the file job wants a second mix rather than an addition, so a run without a disk stays
comparable.
