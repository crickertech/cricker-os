# 186. Derive the architecture list, and close what it does not reach

Built 2026-10-03; it was partial as of 2026-09-23. Seven of the sweep's eleven silent gaps closed, three were already
closed by other lanes before this one looked (findings 3, 6 and 11, which is the reason this block
now says to re-check a row before acting on it), one is milestone 187's, and one is left open with
its reason below. Phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 are done. Minted 2026-08-28, on calef's question against the sweep in pull request
#568: is there a milestone for actually fixing these and driving parity, and there was not. The
sweep is `notes/architecture-list-sweep.md` and it is this milestone's worklist; this block
says what "done" means and in what order, and does not restate the table.

No design fork. The recommendation is argued and priced in the note, the tree
already holds every mechanism it proposes, and every part of it is reversible.

## The finding, in one paragraph

`script/stack-frame-check` gated `arches="aarch64 riscv64"` ten days after x86_64 became a
`script/test` target, and its `BUGS` section, which honestly recorded four other limitations, did
not record that one. The sweep asked how many siblings that line has: eleven silent gaps in nine
files, beside nine recorded gaps that are working as designed and about fifteen things that are
legitimately one architecture's. Rule 5 and §19 (architectural parity is a tenet) make those
bugs; the other twenty-four are not, and the sweep's value is in that split.

The pattern is the actual result. Everything in the tree that stayed complete at three
architectures is either a Rust `match` the compiler pushed on (`kernel/build.rs`'s `panic!` default
arm, `crates/elf`'s `EXPECTED_MACHINE`, `xtask`'s `ArchLegs`) or a per-architecture file whose
absence a build notices. Everything that went stale is a space-separated string in a shell script, a
YAML step, a TOML array, or a sentence in a note. Ten of the eleven silent gaps are in that second
group and the eleventh is a `#[cfg]` pair with no `else`.

## What "done" means

1. Every one of the sweep's eleven silent gaps is either closed or converted into a recorded gap with
   a reason and a trigger, in the shape `script/lint`'s x86_64 block already uses. A recorded gap
   is a legitimate outcome, per rule 5, and forcing all eleven to close would be the wrong reading of
   this milestone.
2. The arch-to-triple table has one authority that the shell scripts read, rather than the
   four copies it has today.
3. A fourth architecture cannot be added without the tree saying where the lists are. That is what
   items A and B below buy, and it is the half that makes this a milestone rather than a cleanup.

## The order, and why the order is load-bearing

Each widening is its own commit and its own green run. This is not tidiness. Newly gating an
architecture runs a check that has never run there, and a check that has never run may have real
offenders. It already does: `script/stack-frame-check --arch x86_64` surfaced
`kernel::arch::x86_64::iommu::init` at 12,504 bytes against a 4,096-byte guard page, found by
the lane on pull request #567 the same night. A milestone that lands eleven widenings in one commit
turns `main` red for a reason unrelated to whoever pushed, and leaves the next reader unable to tell
which widening did it. Milestone 96's loader commit is the precedent: separateness is the argument.

So the worklist is ordered by how likely a widening is to surface work, cheapest first.

### Phase 1: the widenings that cannot surface an offender

These add a target to an install list or a verdict to a linter. Nothing gates code that has not been
gated before, so each is a commit and a green run with no follow-on work possible.

- `script/bootstrap`'s `rustup target add` list.
- `script/toolchain-bump`'s, which is the one that actually bites: it installs against the new
  toolchain, where `rust-toolchain.toml`'s `targets` array does not cover for the omission.
- `script/drift`'s, for the same reason.
- `deny.toml`'s `targets` array. Note this one is a correction, not an addition: it already
  carried a scope note saying x86_64 bare metal "is declared in §19 but not started; it joins this
  list when it does", and it started. cargo-deny may report new advisories on that graph, which is
  the check working rather than the milestone failing.

### Phase 2: the derivation, which is what stops phase 1 recurring

- Option A. One authority for the arch-to-triple table, read by every shell script and every
  `xtask` path. `rust-toolchain.toml` already carries the list, complete at three, and rustup
  already reads it; `script/bootstrap` already parses that same file with a one-line `sed` for
  `channel`. The gap is that nobody extended the parse by one field. About fifteen lines of POSIX
  sh, replacing four hand-written `case "$arch" in` blocks and four bare triple lists.
- Option B's `compile_error!` arm, for the `#[cfg]` pairs with no fallback. Three lines at four
  sites (`crates/virtio`, `components/src/gpu_driver.rs`, `components/src/keyboard_driver.rs`,
  `components/src/virtio_net_transport.rs`),
  with `entropy_backend`'s backend ladder as the in-tree precedent for ending in `compile_error!`
  rather than a fallback.
- Option C is refused, and the refusal is the valuable half. A gate comparing each
  per-architecture file set against the one list would ship with six exceptions against sixteen
  file-set families: three legitimately incomplete (the `dtb` fixtures, the port notes, the
  shootdown notes) and three recorded gaps awaiting their own milestones (`targets/*.json`,
  `bench/fastpath-*.txt`, `fastpath_pad.rs`). An exception table more than a third the size of the
  gate it guards is the limitation `script/stack-frame-check`'s own `BUGS` already records about
  itself, in the entry saying its table is maintained by hand and a function that moves keeps its
  exemption with nothing noticing. It would also not have caught the finding that prompted the
  sweep, which was a string inside a script rather than a missing file.

Phase 2 is where the milestone earns its name. Phase 1 fixes 2026-08-28; phase 2 is what fires when
a fourth architecture arrives.

### Phase 3: the widenings that will surface work, each separately scoped

- `script/stack-depth-check`. Not one word: its `TRAP_FRAME`, `DISPATCH` and `BODY` tables each need
  an x86_64 row, measured against that arch's own `size_of::<TrapFrame>()` and symbol names. Then
  it may fail, and what it finds is not this milestone's to fix (see below).
- CI's bench job, which today runs two of three legs while `bench/baseline-x86_64.txt` is committed
  and `cargo xtask bench --x86 --check` exists. The tripwire is built and recorded and nothing pulls
  it, so the first run may find real drift.
- `script/bench`'s `EXAMPLES`, which names one architecture of three and does not mention `--riscv`,
  which CI runs on every pull request. Documentation, so it cannot fail a gate, but it is the
  FreeBSD standard's own test and it belongs with the leg it documents.
- `script/fastpath-footprint`, whose `arches` is still `aarch64 riscv64` and which has no x86
  mention at all. Not a one-word widening either: it needs `bench/fastpath-x86_64.txt` and
  `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/fastpath_pad.rs`, neither of which exists, plus an x86_64 row in its
  `ROOTS` table.

`script/stack-frame-check` is already done and is the model for this phase. Pull request #567
widened it, ran it, found `iommu::init`'s 12,504-byte frame, and then held x86_64 out of the
*default* set while making it reachable through `--arch`, with a `BUGS` entry recording what was
found and saying that dispositioning the offender is not that gate's call. `main` stayed green by
naming the finding rather than by not looking. Every phase-3 item should end that way, and the
offender it names becomes somebody else's lane.

## What this milestone does not cover

Per this tree's `BUGS` convention, stated where a reader meets the plan rather than discovered
later.

The offenders that widening surfaces are not this milestone's to fix. `iommu::init`'s 12,504-byte
frame is a real finding about x86_64 code, not about an architecture list. Closing it is either a
shrink of that function or a deliberate exception with a reason, and either way it is a lane of its
own. This milestone's job ends at "the gate now asks the question on every architecture"; answering
the question is separate work, and conflating the two is how a mechanical milestone acquires an
unbounded tail.

`notes/arch-audit.md`'s scope gap is not a line item here. That audit read
`kernel/src/arch/aarch64/` and `kernel/src/arch/riscv64/` in full, about 6,200 lines, and has never
read `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/`, which is 18 files and 6,797 lines, larger than the two it did
read combined. It is finding 8 of the sweep and it is genuinely an architecture-list gap, but the
work is not widening a list: it is reading 6,797 lines of hand-written assembly and low-level Rust
looking for the bug class that audit defines, in the least-verified code in the trusted computing
base, on an ISA whose secondary bring-up and VT-d driver have no analogue in what was audited. That
does not fit beside a `rustup target add` line.

Proposed, provisionally, as its own milestone: audit the x86_64 arch tree, on
`notes/arch-audit.md`'s terms. The number is the integrator's to mint; this block does not claim
one. Two things argue for doing it soon rather than eventually: the audit cadence
(`script/audits`, `.github/workflows/audit-cadence.yml`) counts audits against elapsed time and
shipped components and has no notion of an architecture, so a whole unaudited ISA reads to it as
a tree in good standing and nothing will ever raise it; and the note's own argument is that with no
prover for assembly, an audit by reading is the compensating control, which means a third of the
arch tree currently has neither.

No prior art outside the tree was consulted. `AGENTS.md` asks for it read rather than recalled,
and the sweep did not leave the repository, so nothing is claimed. If it is worth an hour, the
question is how a multi-target project keeps one target list authoritative across a build system, a
CI matrix, and a package manifest, which is the general form of option A.

## What was already fixed rather than scheduled

`components/src/pgrep.rs`'s panic handler is not in this milestone, because it was a live defect
rather than a coverage gap and it landed with the sweep. Neither of its two `cfg` arms matched on
x86_64, so control reached a spin loop and a panic burned a thread forever instead of trapping,
which is the opposite of the signal its own comment promised. It was the last hand-rolled panic
handler left outside `user_rt` after milestone 130 swept forty-eight of them, and the fix was to use
`user_rt::panic_handler!()` like every other program in `user/`.

The distinction is worth keeping: a list that is incomplete is this milestone's, and shipped code
that does the wrong thing on an architecture is not something to schedule.

## Effort

Phase 1 is an hour. Phase 2 is a day, most of it in converting the four `case` blocks and checking
that each caller still behaves. Phase 3 is unbounded on its own terms and bounded by this
milestone's scope note: the widenings are small, and what they find is somebody else's lane.

## What was done, 2026-09-23

Phase 1 and the derivation. `script/bootstrap`, `script/toolchain-bump` and
`.github/workflows/toolchain-bump.yml` (which the sweep did not list) now read
`rust-toolchain.toml`'s `targets` array instead of spelling two of three bare-metal targets.
`script/drift` had already done this, by milestone 312 (`script/drift`'s lists are derived), and its
comment is the model the other three follow. The toolchain-bump pair is the one that mattered:
both install against the *new* toolchain, which rustup does not apply the pin's array to, so their
omission was not covered the way every other copy's was. `deny.toml` gained `x86_64-unknown-none`
and lost a scope note that had gone false; `script/supply-chain` is green with the target in, so no
advisory was hiding in that graph. TOML cannot call a script, so that copy stays hand-kept and says
so in its own `BUGS`.

Option B, and it went further than the block priced. The block said three lines at four sites.
It was five sites: `components/src/entropy.rs` had the same two-arm `barrier()` and, unlike the
other four, had no `BUGS` note recording it, so it was the copy nobody knew about. Rather than five
`compile_error!` arms, the five are now one function,
`user_mode_runtime::virtio::virtio_ring_barrier` (name provisional), in the module where four of
those programs already get `virtio_read_reg` and its siblings. That is the higher rung: the fallback
exists once, and a sixth driver gets the third architecture by calling the function rather than by
remembering to write an arm.

x86_64 got a compiler fence, and the reason is per-site rather than a default. Every call site
in those five programs asks for store-store (descriptor before available index; index before notify)
or load-load (used index before the payload it gates), both of which TSO gives for the write-back
memory a coherent DMA agent shares, and the store-load case it does not give is unreachable because
every notify and register access in these drivers leaves the process through a serializing syscall.
`components/src/non_volatile_memory_express.rs` keeps `dmb sy` and a real `mfence` and did not join
the shared function: its doorbell is a direct store to a device-typed page in this address space,
with no syscall between the ring stores and it. Same hardware, different answer, which is what makes
the compiler-fence argument falsifiable rather than convenient.

Phase 3, partly. `script/bench`'s `EXAMPLES` now names all three architectures and their
baselines, with `--real` stated as aarch64-only by construction rather than by omission. CI's
`fastpath-footprint` job installed two bare-metal targets a month after `script/fastpath-footprint`
widened its own `arches` to three; it now installs three. CI's `stack-frame-check` job stays at two
and its comment now says that is a decision rather than repeating the parity rule while naming two
of three.

Phase 3, finished (2026-10-03). `script/stack-depth-check` now gates all three architectures.
It reads its list from `rust-toolchain.toml`: every `targets` entry whose OS field is `none`, the
way `script/toolchain-bump` does. The x86_64 rows were measured from the built test images. Nothing
was estimated. `TRAP_FRAME` is 176, which is `size_of::<TrapFrame>()` and is asserted in
`exceptions.rs`. `DISPATCH` is `x86_trap_dispatch` and `BODY` is `x86_trap_body`.

x86_64 has a second ring-3 entry that the other two lack, `x86_syscall_handler`. A user thread's
trap therefore takes the larger of the two roots. Each `call` also pushes an 8-byte return address
that `-Z emit-stack-sizes` omits, so the script adds it.

The first run found no offender. A thread stack peaks at 9224 bytes (kernel image) and 12280
(system tests) of 24576. The interrupt stack carries 4544 of 16384. The large frame in
`iommu::init` is not reachable from a thread entry point.

A deliberately broken row (`TRAP_FRAME` for x86_64 set to 17600000) exits 1 with "does not fit".
A misspelled dispatch symbol exits 1 with "no symbol". An architecture in the pin with no rows fails
with a message naming the three tables. CI's `stack-depth-check` job installs the x86_64 target.

The sweep of other hardcoded lists found one more silent gap and closed it. The `watchdog_probe`
clippy line in `script/lint` skipped x86_64 with no recorded reason. It passes once a doc backtick
in `kernel/src/pci.rs` is fixed.

## Follow-on

- **Done.** Findings 2, 4, 5, 7 and 9 are closed, and the CI target lists the sweep did not name
  are closed with them.
- **Recorded.** Hardcoded two-architecture lists that remain are decisions with their reasons in
  place: `script/stack-frame-check`'s default set and its CI job (x86_64 held out behind `--arch`
  for `iommu::init`'s frame), `script/lint`'s clippy block for the build-mode features x86_64 does
  not compile, and `xtask`'s `icount` (no x86_64 leg, reason in its source). Not checked by any
  mechanism: nothing stops a new gate spelling its own list.
- **Recorded.** `virtio_ring_barrier` is a provisional name. It is a new public function, which
  is an architect's call; it sits in `user_mode_runtime::virtio` and carries that module's `virtio_`
  prefix, which is the argument for it, and nothing about the fix depends on the spelling.
- **Recorded.** The rung-1 limit this milestone's own note states still holds: deriving the list
  removes the copy, not the incompleteness. Nothing stops a new gate writing
  `for arch in aarch64 riscv64`, and `deny.toml` cannot read the derivation at all. The
  `compile_error!` in `virtio_ring_barrier` is the one place in this territory where a missing
  architecture now fails to build rather than failing to order.
- **Milestone 187.** Finding 8, the unaudited x86_64 arch tree, is milestone 187 (read the x86_64
  arch tree through the lens the first arch audit used), which was minted for it.

## Index row

`script/stack-frame-check` gated two of three architectures ten days after the third became a test
target, with nothing in its BUGS section saying so; the sweep in notes/architecture-list-sweep.md
found eleven silent gaps in nine files, beside nine recorded gaps that are working as designed.
Everything in the tree that stayed complete at three is a Rust `match` the compiler pushed on or a
file whose absence a build notices; everything stale is a string in a shell script, a YAML step,
or a TOML array. Phased so each widening is its own commit and its own green run, since newly
gating an architecture surfaces real offenders (`--arch x86_64` already found a 12,504-byte
frame). Recommends deriving the one list `rust-toolchain.toml` already carries, refuses a file-set
gate whose exception table would be a third its own size, and scopes out both the offenders that
widening finds and notes/arch-audit.md's 6,797 unaudited lines.
