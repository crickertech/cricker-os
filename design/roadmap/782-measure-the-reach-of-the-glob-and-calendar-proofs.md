# 782. Measure the reach of the glob and calendar proofs

Raised by the risk-2 reach study (`lane/kani-reach`, milestone 741 (does a standing proof notice a
regression)) on 2026-10-04 (UTC). Title and slug are drafts.

The study measured 189 harnesses and skipped glob's 6 and calendar's 11 on cost. With
`--reached-only` they were estimated at 53 and 38 Kani CPU-hours, against 29 for the other 23
packages combined. The estimate came within 6% of elf's measured cost. Their proofs are the slowest
in `script/verify`'s table (902 s and 600 s), so they are also where a weak proof costs the most
to keep.

## Done when

- Both packages are measured by `.github/workflows/kani-reach.yml` at `max-parallel: 4`, a few
  shards at a time so the shared runners stay free (`package:shards:only` runs one shard of n).
- Their rows are added to `notes/kani-reach-2026-10-04.md` and its CSV, or to a dated successor.

## Index row

The reach study skipped glob's 6 and calendar's 11 harnesses on cost, and their proofs are the slowest in the verify table. Measuring them at bounded parallelism completes the study and shows where the most expensive weak proofs would be.
