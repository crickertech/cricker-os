# 862. The comment-block sweep's next worth

*(Minted 2026-10-09 (UTC) by lane `milestone/862-the-comment-block-sweeps-next-worth` from the proposal `the-comment-block-sweeps-next-worth`. The number is provisional until the merge queue lands it; the title and slug are drafts.)*


Raised 2026-10-09 (UTC) by the lane building milestone 860 (comments state the constraint as it
is now). It filed this at the end of its worth. §267 (a comment states the constraint as it is
now) caps a comment block at 40 lines. `helpers/comment_block_ratchet.py` holds the cap against
`design/comment-block-baseline.tsv` (both names provisional). The baseline held 338 rows when the
gate landed and holds 337 after milestone 860's worth. The sweep works through them per file,
worst first, one milestone's worth at a time.

The next worst after that worth, with their rows: `kernel/src/testing.rs:240` (468 lines),
`crates/system_initializer/src/lib.rs:6` (406), `components/src/timetable.rs:1` (224),
`crates/jh7110_entropy/src/lib.rs:2` (209), then `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/iommu.rs:1` and
`crates/job_mix/src/lib.rs:1` (197 each). A worth takes the worst handful. Each block's history
moves to a commit message, its findings to a note, its semantics to a `§N` citation. The shrinks
are banked (`python3 helpers/comment_block_ratchet.py --bank`). The method, the refused
alternatives and the evidence are milestone 860's block and `notes/comment-cost-2026-10-07.md`.
This worth claims no new decision, only the next slice of a ruled sweep.

Reuse: the ratchet, the lexer and the baseline already exist (milestone 860 built them). This
worth only runs the sweep and banks, and takes no new code.

## The worth, 2026-10-09 (UTC): built

Worst first, each shrunk block banked as it fell:

- `kernel/src/testing.rs:240` (468 lines): the frame-budget ledger left for
  `notes/frame-budget.md`, its dated narrative compressed to a number-line table there and its
  stories left to the commits that wrote them. The doc comment is 35 lines and its row is gone
  (337 rows to 336).
- `crates/system_initializer/src/lib.rs:6` (406): the mutation essay deleted to a pointer at
  milestone 244 (the largest crate in the tree is proved by nothing a mutation can reach)'s
  block, the naming saga moved to `design/naming/crates.md`, the history
  compressed to pointers. Banked at 301. The bulk that remains is the `no_run` doctest that
  type-checks the whole `BootEndowment` literal, which is a gate and stays. This row stays on the
  baseline at its banked ceiling.
- `components/src/timetable.rs:1` (224): the `--mem` design essay moved to
  `notes/scheduled-execution/mem-entries.md`. Banked at 201.
- `crates/jh7110_entropy/src/lib.rs:2` (209): the naming saga moved to
  `design/naming/jh7110-entropy-name.md`, the health-test lane meta folded into the standing
  fact. Banked at 171.
- `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/iommu.rs:1` (197): the FIXED detective stories compressed to their
  still-true facts, the §86 (whether an NVMe driver can leave the kernel) restatement replaced by a citation of
  that section's own amendment. Banked at
  164.
- `crates/job_mix/src/lib.rs:1` (197): the naming saga and the console-marker rule moved to
  `design/naming/job-mix-name.md`. Banked at 141.

## Follow-on

- **Proposed.** `design/roadmap/proposals/the-comment-block-sweep-continues.md`: worth three,
  with the new worst-first list. The baseline still holds 336 rows.

## Index row

The comment-block sweep's next worth: the 337 over-cap blocks the baseline holds, swept a milestone's worth at a time, worst first. Every shrink is banked, so the baseline only falls. History moves to commit messages, findings to notes, rulings to sections.
