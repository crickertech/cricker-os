# 607. nife is built and updated from packages, and the repository divides along what releases together

The number is provisional: the integrator mints it at merge. calef asked for it on 2026-09-26
(UTC). A design lane (`milestone/607-packages-and-divisions`) wrote the forks and built nothing.

Four records touch the question and none joins the others. Milestone 39 (repository structure for a loosely-coupled OS) recorded a monorepo now and
a split later. §151 (the goal of the repository split is independent release) made the split's goal independent release and third-party programs. Milestone
198 installs programs and does not build the OS. Milestones 525 and 554 swap a whole image between
two boot slots. This block asks how a package becomes part of the OS, and where the repository's
seams are.

## What the design lane found

The forks are in [§235 (the OS is built and updated from packages)](../decisions/0235-packages-build-the-os-and-the-tree-divides-by-release.md)
(provisional number), DECIDED 2026-09-27. The measurements and the prior art are in
[notes/packages-and-divisions.md](../../notes/packages-and-divisions.md). Three findings shape it:

- The kernel's compiled-in trust root pins every base program, so the kernel relinks whenever
  userspace changes. It cannot release on its own while that holds.
- The kernel crate is also the integrator and the system test suite: `kernel/src/user/` is 28,441
  of its 89,885 lines, and it links nine service crates and three fixture crates.
- Contracts still change with their consumers: 76% of contract commits in 60 days touched another
  division. §151's precondition for ruling the split's order is not met.

## The rulings

calef ruled on every fork on 2026-09-27 (UTC), relayed by the maintainer on pull request #1389.
§235 records them with his words.

- The trust root is T4 with T2: the loader hands over the progenitor and manifest digests, the
  kernel checks the progenitor, and the progenitor checks the base set.
- Packages are the update unit, and each slot holds a full copy (U4), ruled 2026-09-27. The shared
  store (U2) is refused: calef judged its disk saving not worth the risk of a brick.
- Item 2 below is decided, and `milestone/609-system-tests-leave-the-kernel` is building it.
- The SDK is S2 now, one archive per release with C headers and the prebuilt runtime library, and
  S3 (an upstream Rust target) once `milestone/610-interface-stability` shows the interfaces stable.
  S1 is not planned.
- The ABI revision is a field in the manifest note of milestone 597 (a program carries its manifest in an ELF note), not a separate note.
- The repositories: R1 now, with package boundaries drawn in-tree and enforced by lint. The end
  state is every package leaving this repository. Each package's definition carries a required
  `home` with no default. `milestone/611-package-boundaries` is building the boundaries.
- Composition follows the Linux distributions: a package is what releases together and may hold
  several programs, while authority stays per program. Base services with no Linux counterpart
  still need nife's own grouping, which is a follow-on.

## What is built

Nothing. The block is NOT-STARTED until a proposal below has a lane.

## What is left

The proposals, none minted, in the recommended order. §235 has the reasoning.

1. The image is assembled from base packages by digest (host side; waits on nothing).
2. The kernel crate stops carrying the userspace bring-up and the system tests (decided; in the
   lane `milestone/609-system-tests-leave-the-kernel`).
3. A contract never links the runtime: `supervision_protocol` and `swap_protocol` (waits on nothing).
4. A third party builds `greeting` with no clone of this repository (S2 and the ABI revision's note field ruled; waits on nothing).
5. An OS update is a set of packages that lands through a slot (U4 ruled; waits on item 1).
6. The loader hands over two digests and the progenitor checks the base set (ruled; waits on item 2).
7. Package boundaries drawn in-tree and checked by lint, each with a required `home` (decided; in
   the lane `milestone/611-package-boundaries`).

## BUGS

- Division names are this lane's and provisional; calef names them. Package names are his too.
- Open follow-ons, none of them a fork: the grouping of base services with no Linux counterpart,
  package names, and the format of a package's in-tree definition.
- The image size quoted in §235 is a stale local build, and item 1's lane should measure a fresh one.
