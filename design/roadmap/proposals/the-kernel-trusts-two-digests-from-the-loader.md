# The kernel trusts two digests handed to it by the loader

Filed by the maintainer, recording calef's ruling on pull request #1389, 2026-09-27 (UTC): "T4 with
T2". That pull request is design work for a still-open fork on how packages build the OS and the
tree divides by what releases together; the section it will land in is not yet merged, so this
proposal cites the pull request rather than a section number. Every name here is provisional.

## What changes

Today `kernel/build.rs` compiles `TRUST_ROOT` into the kernel: the progenitor's digest and the
table of base program digests, `PROGRAM_MEASUREMENTS`. Any base service change relinks the kernel,
which is why milestone 104 (the measurement continues past init) makes the kernel release as one
unit with the base image.

Under T4 with T2, the boot loader hands the kernel two digests at handoff, on all three
architectures: the progenitor's own digest, and a digest over the base manifest, the package set an
image is built from. The kernel checks only the progenitor's digest before running it, and stops
parsing a program table at all. The progenitor, once running, checks the base set against the
manifest digest the loader gave it, the same way it already refuses an unlisted program (milestone
104).

## What this buys, and what it costs

The kernel binary stops depending on the base set. It still depends on the progenitor, so the two
release together, but a base service can change without relinking the kernel. §151 (the goal of the
repository split is independent release) is not fully reachable this way; T2's own costs stay:
trust moves to the loader, which only milestone 500 (a stick that boots with Secure Boot on) or the
slot checksum protects, and there are three handoff paths to change (device tree `/chosen` on
aarch64 and riscv64, PVH on x86_64). Milestone 525 (a bad upgrade cannot brick the machine) records
that the device-tree path has one initrd slot.

Signatures stay exactly where §220 (signed builds) put them, at install and update time, out of the
boot path. This does not move a signature check to boot; it only changes what the kernel is handed
and what it checks before running the progenitor.

Comparable system: Fuchsia checks the `system_image` Merkle root, carried in signed boot arguments,
in userspace rather than in the kernel.

## Dependency and what is calef's

This depends on the base manifest: an image assembled from base packages by digest, which pull
request #1389 proposes and which is not yet built. The loader-to-kernel handoff is a layout two
programs agree on, so its exact bytes come to calef, the same way the loader-to-kernel handoff
always has.

One consequence worth a decision of its own, not folded into this one: once the kernel can update
separately from userspace, the syscall surface becomes a versioned ABI that already-installed
programs rely on. Pull request #1389 does not settle that, and this proposal does not either.
