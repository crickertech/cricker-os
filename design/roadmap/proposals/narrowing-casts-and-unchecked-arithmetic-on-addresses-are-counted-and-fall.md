# Narrowing casts and unchecked arithmetic on syscall arguments and addresses are counted, and the count falls

Raised by a maintainer session on 2026-10-09 (UTC), one of five lint proposals asked for together.
Its numbers are in [notes/lint-census-2026-10-09.md](../../../notes/lint-census-2026-10-09.md).
It reuses the lint ratchet specified in
[the panic proposal](panics-in-the-kernel-and-the-parsers-are-counted-and-fall.md); whichever of the
two is promoted first builds it.

Reuse: clippy's `cast_possible_truncation`, `cast_sign_loss`, `cast_possible_wrap` and
`arithmetic_side_effects`. Nothing is written but the ratchet's filter described below.

## The rulings, 2026-10-09 (UTC)

The architect in session ruled on three of this proposal's questions on 2026-10-09 (UTC). That
architect is not listed in [ARCHITECTS.md](../../../ARCHITECTS.md), so the record names the role and
the session rather than a username.

- Open question 1: the `u64`/`i64` to `usize` filter gets a short decision of its own rather than
  stretching §61. It is
  [§268 (the cast ratchet does not count a 64-bit integer cast to `usize`)](../../decisions/0268-the-cast-ratchet-does-not-count-a-64-bit-integer-cast-to-usize.md),
  `PROPOSED` with a provisional number.
- Open question 2: the scope is the 16 measured files. A file is added only when a concrete path
  from a syscall argument into it is shown.
- Open question 4, and the thresholds: cast counts are frozen per file at today's value and may only
  go down. There is no zero-by-date target, so done criteria 2 and 3 below were rewritten to match.

## The problem

An `as` cast that narrows does not fail. It keeps the low bits, so a physical address cut to 32
bits is a plausible wrong address rather than an error. In a kernel, a wrong address is how a
confinement break gets built. Arithmetic is the other half. Release builds keep overflow checks
(calef, 2026-10-04, `notes/overflow-checks.md`), so an overflow halts rather than wraps. That makes
unchecked arithmetic on a caller's value a reachable panic, the panic proposal's class.

Measured over non-test code, the note's scope:

- `as <integer>` appears 3,262 times, 945 of them in the kernel. The request's grep said about
  5,000; the gap is test code.
- Clippy flags 844 `cast_possible_truncation` hits (271 kernel), 155 `cast_possible_wrap` (30),
  185 `cast_sign_loss` (3) and 3,218 `arithmetic_side_effects` (648).
- `kernel/src/syscall.rs` has 7 truncation, 21 wrap, 2 sign-loss and 8 arithmetic hits.
- The memory and page-table code has 36 truncation, 4 wrap and 167 arithmetic hits. That is
  `memory.rs`, `memory_region.rs`, `kmem.rs`, `revoke.rs`, `user.rs`, the three `arch/*/mmu.rs`,
  and the crates `paging`, `page_frames`, `memory_regions` and `address_space_map`.

## What this tree already decided, and why this proposal reopens it

§61 (a lint is adopted on evidence from this tree) dropped `cast_possible_truncation` on
2026-08-03, and `Cargo.toml` records why. Of 497 hits then, 199 were `u64` or `i64` to `usize`.
Those warn about 32-bit pointers, and §19 (architectural parity is a tenet) names three 64-bit
targets only. A gate more than half inapplicable trains a reader to skim.

The ratio holds today: 340 of 844 hits are that class, and 143 of the kernel's 271. Clippy still
has no setting for pointer width (read from `cargo clippy --explain` on this toolchain).

What changed is the instrument. §61's objection was to `-D warnings` over every hit. The lint
ratchet reads clippy's JSON, and each truncation message names both types. So the ratchet can
drop the `u64`/`i64` to `usize` class before it counts. That leaves 504 genuine narrowings in
scope, 128 in the kernel. A reader sees no inapplicable hit. This is a new mechanism beside §61's
ruling, not a reversal of it, and an architect should say so if it is not.

## The mechanism, and its rung

Rung one exists and was considered. Address newtypes (a physical and a virtual address type in
`paging`) would make most address truncations unrepresentable. The tree has none today; `paging`
speaks `u64`. Introducing them touches every mapping call on three architectures, and it is a
design fork of its own. It is open question 3, not this milestone.

So rung two: the lint ratchet, with the filter above, over the scope below. A site leaves the
count by becoming `u32::try_from(x)?`, a checked or explicitly `wrapping_` operation, or a
`const` assertion where the bound is a compile-time fact.

## Scope

Ruled 2026-10-09 (UTC): `kernel/src/syscall.rs`, the memory and page-table files listed above, and
the four crates. That is 16 files with 213 hits after the filter drops 32: 167 arithmetic, 11 truncation,
25 wrap and 2 sign-loss. The rest of the tree is not counted.
Widening it is a reviewed edit to the scope list, and it needs a concrete path from a syscall
argument into the new file. The parsers' arithmetic belongs to the panic
proposal, which shares the overflow boundary.

## Done when

1. The four lints run in the lint ratchet over the scope, with §268's `usize` filter and a
   selftest fixture that proves the filter drops exactly that class.
2. The baseline freezes each of the 16 files at its count on 2026-10-09 (UTC), and a row may only go
   down. `syscall.rs`'s 29 cast hits fall as each is fixed or given an
   `#[expect(..., reason = "...")]` saying why the value is in range, with no date to reach zero.
3. A file joins the scope only with a shown path from a syscall argument into it, in the same
   change that adds its row.
4. The `Cargo.toml` paragraph that records `cast_possible_truncation` as deliberately absent is
   amended to say where the lint now runs and why.

## Open questions for an architect

1. Ruled 2026-10-09 (UTC): a section of its own, §268 (provisional). The question was whether a
   filtered ratchet is acceptable against §61's rule.
2. Ruled 2026-10-09 (UTC): the 16 measured files, and a file is added only when a concrete path
   from a syscall argument is shown. So `sched.rs` and `cap.rs` stay out until one is.
3. Address newtypes in `paging`: worth a milestone of their own? It is the rung-one answer and the
   larger change.
4. Ruled 2026-10-09 (UTC): a ceiling, frozen at today's value per file, that only falls. The
   question was whether `arithmetic_side_effects` in the memory scope ratchets to zero.

## Where it sits in the ranking

The customer path is vacant, so the tie breaks toward the fatal risks. This serves risk 7 (the
confinement claim is false), since a truncated address is a confinement break's raw material. It
ranks third of the five, behind the panic proposal (which shares its overflow half) and the
`static mut` proposal, which is smaller and touches risk 5 directly.
