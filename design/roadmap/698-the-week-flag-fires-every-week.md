# 698. The week flag fires every week

Promoted from `design/roadmap/proposals/the-week-flag-fires-every-week.md` on 2026-10-03 (UTC). The number 698 was minted by the maintainer in a batch promotion of the proposal pile and is provisional until the queue lands it. *(Title and slug are drafts.)*

<!-- writing-standards: exception. Granted 2026-10-03 (UTC) by the maintainer minting this milestone, not ratified by an architect. Reason: this block was promoted unedited from design/roadmap/proposals/, which the prose scope excludes, so it meets the sentence and bold limits only after an edit that promotion does not make. Trimming it is a separate pass, and the exception goes when it is done. -->

Raised on 2026-09-29 (UTC) by the lane building milestone 623 (bullet under the chart explains a
cliff), while it built the flag calef commissioned.
The threshold came from the proposal verbatim; the build measured what it does on real data, and
the measurement belongs in front of whoever rules on the constant.

## What the build measured

`script/metrics --flags` over the ten charted weeks 2026W31 to 2026W40, each week compared with
the week before it in the series, seventy-three series charted. Variants were measured by editing
one constant and one comparison in copies of the built flag, so the table is the implementation's
own arithmetic and not a re-derivation:

| variant | series flagging, by week (min to max) | weeks with nothing flagged |
| --- | --- | --- |
| one tenth, both directions (as built) | 16 to 44 | 0 of 10 |
| one tenth, drops only | 4 to 18 | 0 of 10 |
| one quarter, both directions | 10 to 33 | 0 of 10 |
| one quarter, drops only | 3 to 16 | 0 of 10 |

The cause is structural, not a bad week: most charted series are counts or churn flows, and a
young project grows and churns them faster than any of these bars. Under every variant the
2026W40 kernel cliff flags (kernel code fell 29%), and under every variant something flags every
week, so no flat bar fully separates a cliff from ordinary motion on this data.

A drift that moves a series a twentieth each week never flags, which the original proposal already
recorded as the threshold's other blind spot.

## Options

| option | what it is | verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A. Keep one tenth, both directions | the rule as built | Refused as the answer. Measured: 16 to 44 series a week flag, and the one-line report is ten lines most weeks |
| B. Drops only, one tenth | flag only a series that fell more than a tenth | **Recommended.** Cliffs read as drops: the motivating case, and 2026W38's proposals falling 83 to 2, are drops, while growth is this project's normal direction. Min to max falls to 4 to 18 |
| C. One quarter, both directions | raise the bar on either direction | Refused. Measured 10 to 33. It buys less than B and buries small real drops, a 15% fall included |
| D. Drops only, one quarter | B with a higher bar | Refused. Measured 3 to 16, the quietest, but it would miss a 20% fall in a series that had earned a reader's trust |
| E. A per-series band | flag a move outside the series' own trailing range | Refused by cost: seventy-three bespoke bands are a second dashboard to maintain |

The recommendation is B: one word of rule added to the constant already in `script/metrics`, and
the honest caveat that even then a week with nothing worth explaining will sometimes flag,
because this tree's counts move. An architect rules with the table above in hand; the constant
lives beside `CHART_WEEKS` either way.

Name provisional.

## Index row

The week-over-week flag calef commissioned flagged 16 to 44 of 73 series every week for ten weeks. Proposed: rule on a threshold that flags something rarer, with the measured variants in front of the ruling.
