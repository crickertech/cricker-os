# 864. The comment-block sweep continues again, worth four

*(Minted 2026-10-10 (UTC) by lane `milestone/864-the-comment-block-sweep-continues-again` from the proposal `the-comment-block-sweep-continues-again`. The number is provisional until the merge queue lands it; the title and slug are drafts.)*


Raised 2026-10-09 (UTC) by the lane that built milestone 863 (the comment-block sweep continues,
worth three), at the end of its worth. §267 (a comment states the constraint as it is now) caps a
comment block at 40 lines. Its 2026-10-09 amendment rules the method: the constraint stays,
history goes to the commit message and git, and no refusal narrative is transplanted into a
document.

The baseline holds 336 rows. The worst after worth three:
`crates/jh7110_clock_and_reset/src/lib.rs:2` (184), `crates/current_cpu_protocol/src/lib.rs:1`
(183), `components/src/login.rs:1` (178), then `crates/jh7110_entropy/src/lib.rs:2` and
`crates/board_console/src/lib.rs:1` (176 each). A worth takes the worst handful that is not a
gated example, and every shrink is banked. The method, the
refused alternatives and the evidence are milestone 860 (comments state the constraint as it
is now)'s block and
`notes/comment-cost-2026-10-07.md`.

Reuse: the ratchet, the lexer and the baseline already exist (milestone 860 built them). This
worth only runs the sweep and banks, and takes no new code.

## The worth, 2026-10-10 (UTC): built

Under the amended method (constraint stays, history to the commit message and git, no transplant
documents):

- `crates/jh7110_clock_and_reset/src/lib.rs:2` 184 to 103: a hundred lines of quoted device
  trees and C code replaced by the facts, the agreement and the rebasing arithmetic; the fenced
  listings are in the removal commit's diff and the linked sources.
- `crates/current_cpu_protocol/src/lib.rs:1` 183 to 176: the 2026-09-21 ruling is now cited as
  §204 (how userspace asks where a thread runs), which landed long after the doc called it
  unlanded, and the refusal list went to git.
- `components/src/login.rs:1` 178 to 177: the two history appendices milestone 860 created under
  `notes/login/` are deleted per the amendment, the one constraint they excused is said inline,
  and 860's garbled pointer sentence is fixed.
- `crates/jh7110_entropy/src/lib.rs:2` 176 to 166: the source bullets keep identity, dates and
  facts; the fetch mechanics went to git.
- `crates/board_console/src/lib.rs:1` 176 to 173: the Miri section keeps the measurement and the
  mechanisms, not the narration.

## Follow-on

- **Milestone 865.** Milestone 865 (the comment-block sweep's worth five). Next worst: `components/src/timetable.rs:1` (191), `components/src/login.rs:1`
  (177), `crates/current_cpu_protocol/src/lib.rs:1` (176), `components/src/system_installer.rs:1`
  (175), `crates/board_console/src/lib.rs:1` (173).

## Index row

Worth four of the comment-block sweep: the worst five over-cap blocks shrunk to their constraints and banked, history to commit messages and git, no transplant documents.
