# 761. Capability lookup off the global lock

Promoted from `design/roadmap/proposals/capability-lookup-off-the-global-lock.md` on 2026-10-04
(UTC) by the lane `lane/capability-lock-per-thread`. The number 761 is provisional until the queue
lands it. *(Title and slug are drafts.)* `needs_person` is yes only because the result is taken at
radon's bench.

## Index row

The cheapest syscall stops taking the kernel's one global lock: each thread's capability table gets
its own lock, so a lookup contends with nobody. Fatal risk 4's open finding is the null syscall
costing 147 ticks a job at four busy cores on radon against 99 at one. 41% of its lookups found
`IPC_TABLES` held. This is the change that finding pointed at. On radon (2026-10-05) the lookups
that wait fell to 0.05% and the job's rise from one task to four from 48 ticks to 10.

## Why

Every syscall that names a capability starts in `sched::current_cap`, which took `IPC_TABLES`, the
kernel's one global lock, to read the calling thread's own table. On radon at four busy tasks 41%
of those lookups found the lock held, and the null syscall cost 147 ticks a job against 99 at one
task ([`notes/job-mix/null-syscall-under-load.md`](../../notes/job-mix/null-syscall-under-load.md)).
A capability table has exactly one owner thread; it shared the global lock only because it was a
field of the thread table's entries. This is fatal risk 4's open finding.

## What was built

- Each thread's capability table has its own lock, an `IrqSafeMutex` at the new rank 57
  (`sync::rank::CAPABILITY_TABLE`), stored in the free space of the thread's TCB page past its FP
  register file (`thread::capability_table_of`), no longer a field of `Thread`. Outside the struct
  is the soundness argument, written at the type: another core holding `IPC_TABLES` may hold a
  `&mut Thread` for the running thread, and a `&mut` covers every byte of the struct.
- The running thread reaches its table through a per-core pointer (`CURRENT_CAPABILITIES`), set
  only by `set_current` beside `PerCpu::current`. `current_cap`, `grant`, `grant_at` and
  `delete_current_cap` take that table's lock and nothing else. On x86_64 a deleted `PortRange`
  still takes `IPC_TABLES`, to clear the cached grant under it.
- The order is written at the rank and enforced by the ranking check. Anything touching another
  thread's table holds `IPC_TABLES` and takes the table under it (60 then 57). A table holder takes
  nothing, and two tables are never held at once.
- Why the pointer cannot dangle: a running thread's page is recycled only by `Threads::remove`,
  reached from the successor's reap and from region teardown, which refuses `Running` threads and
  threads a core stands on. The argument is written at `CURRENT_CAPABILITIES`. No new loom model:
  the pointer adds no protocol, it rides the switch-out handshake loom already searches.
- `sync::lock_found` takes a lock found through per-core state with one interrupt mask, and
  `sched::deliver_capability` is one out-of-line copy of the IPC delivery insert. Both exist to keep
  the fast paths inside their bands (below).

No syscall semantics, ABI or wire format changed. Names `CAPABILITY_TABLE` (rank),
`CapabilityTableLock`, `capability_table_of`, `init_capability_table`, `CURRENT_CAPABILITIES`,
`set_current`, `current_capabilities`, `lock_found`, `deliver_capability`,
`get_mut_with_capabilities`, `iter_mut_with_capabilities` and `capabilities` are provisional.

## What QEMU said

riscv64 TCG, `script/job-mix --arch riscv64 --smp 4 --release --lock-wait`, two runs each side,
interleaved on the same host:

| At 4 tasks | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `current_cap` calls that found their lock held | 92,286 and 99,195 of 480,000 (19 to 21%) | 17 and 25 |
| `IPC_TABLES` contended acquisitions | 361,138 and 392,402 | 259,777 and 269,260 (down 29%) |
| rank 57 (`capability_table`) contended | (no such lock) | 30 and 42 |

The counts are the result TCG can give. Its ticks cannot: the host carried other lanes' builds, and
`null_syscall` at four tasks read 1,066 to 1,861 across six runs a side with no separation, which is
the null-syscall note's own caveat. The size of the win is radon's to say.

## Gates

- Kernel suite, riscv64, local: 135 kernel and 284 system tests passed (4 skipped). CI runs all three.
- `script/fastpath-footprint`: within band on all three ISAs (`ipc_call_reply` +1.7% aarch64,
  +1.5% riscv64, +0.05% x86_64). The first cut was over on two, and `current_cap` had grown from 256
  to 584 bytes on riscv64 (a double interrupt mask, and a result LLVM copied byte by byte); the
  second commit is that fix.
- `script/stack-frame-check`, `script/icount` (riscv64) and `script/bench --check` (aarch64, riscv64)
  pass. Against the pre-change tree on riscv64 icount, `yield_switch` is +3.5% and `call_reply` +4.1%
  (the per-switch pointer store, in the bench's debug kernel), `ipc_rtt_el0` -0.6%.
- Five falsification patches re-cut against the moved code and replayed red as predicted.

## What radon said

2026-10-05 (UTC), by a run sheet written before any boot
([`bench/radon-2026-10-05/`](../../bench/radon-2026-10-05/README.md), read in full in
[the appendix](../../notes/job-mix/radon-2026-10-05.md)). Built from `c8b5fd09e`, which also
carries milestone 766 (each core's PerCpu on its own cache line). At four tasks:

| | 2026-10-04 | 2026-10-05 |
|---|---|---|
| `current_cap` calls that found their lock held (`lock_wait` boots) | 41.4%, 41.8% | 0.048%, 0.049% |
| `IPC_TABLES` wait (`lock_wait` boots) | 2,593,130 ticks | 1,241,793 and 1,278,777 |
| `null_syscall` `per_job`, 1 / 4 tasks (three boots) | 99 / 147 | 110 / 120 |
| growth from 1 task to 4 | 48 | 10 |

By the pre-written bands, 120 reads PARTIAL and the one-task guard failed (110, above 101). The
guard's rise is code placement, not this milestone: a rebuild of the old commit read 99 again, and
shifting `main`'s text alone moved one task from 110 to 118. Growth with cores held within a tick
across those layouts, and it is what fell. This milestone is done; what remains of the rise, about
5 ticks a job, is not a lock.

## BUGS

- A capability read and a capability granted are two critical sections, so a revocation sweep
  can fall between them. Take a syscall that derives: it reads a capability with `current_cap`,
  then `grant`s a narrowed copy. A sweep in between deletes the source and the copy is still filed. Unverified, found by reading while proving this milestone's linearizability argument, and
  not new: with one global lock the two steps were already two acquisitions. This milestone neither
  widens nor narrows the window. It lives here until somebody drives a sweep into that gap.

- `current_capabilities` returns a guard typed `'static` to a table that lives as long as its
  thread. Sound because no caller blocks or switches while holding it, and private to `sched`; a
  caller that held it across `schedule()` would be the bug.
- **Even-numbered capability slots straddle a cache line.** The table starts at byte 696 of the
  thread page and a slot is 32 bytes, so slot `i` starts at 56 mod 64 for every even `i` and spans
  two 64-byte lines. The same in every build measured on 2026-10-05, so not that evening's one-task
  rise, and the job's empty slot (63) is odd. Unmeasured; aligning the table's start to 64 would
  remove it. Found reading the layout for the radon bisect.
- The `site=current_cap` counter now measures the thread's own table lock. Its meaning is the same
  (how often the cheapest syscall waited), and its rank in the per-rank lines moved from 60 to 57.

## Follow-on

- **Done.** The radon evening, 2026-10-05 (UTC), above, from `c8b5fd09e` rather than `74bbb19a1`.
- **Milestone 17.** The IPC and scheduler rows (`schedule`, `CALL`, `REPLY`, `finish_switch`) stay on
  `IPC_TABLES`; splitting the thread table is milestone 17 (multikernel-leaning scheduler)'s question.
- **Milestone 766.** `PERCPU` straddling cache lines, built and material on radon (7.5 ticks a job).
- **Recorded.** The derive-then-grant window, the `'static` guard and the straddling even slots, in
  this block's BUGS.
