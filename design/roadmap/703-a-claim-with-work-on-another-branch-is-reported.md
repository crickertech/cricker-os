# 703. A claim with its work on another branch is reported

Promoted from `design/roadmap/proposals/a-claim-with-work-on-another-branch-is-reported.md` on 2026-10-03 (UTC). The number 703 was minted by the maintainer in a batch promotion of the proposal pile and is provisional until the queue lands it. *(Title and slug are drafts.)*

<!-- writing-standards: exception. Granted 2026-10-03 (UTC) by the maintainer minting this milestone, not ratified by an architect. Reason: this block was promoted unedited from design/roadmap/proposals/, which the prose scope excludes, so it meets the sentence and bold limits only after an edit that promotion does not make. Trimming it is a separate pass, and the exception goes when it is done. -->

Raised 2026-10-02 by the lane that built the empty-diff check (milestone 627 (a pull request that changes nothing does not merge), provisional number).
#1460 claimed under `lane/fatal-risk-colors` while the work was pushed to
`milestone/fatal-risk-colors`, a branch that descends from the claim commit. The draft never moved.

`helpers/lane-claim-check.sh` reports pushed branches with no pull request. It misses this shape,
because the work branch descends from a claim whose pull request exists. The addition: report a
pushed branch that contains a `claim:` commit belonging to a pull request whose head is a different
ref and whose head has not moved past that commit. It reports and never acts, like the rest of that
script. The empty-diff check catches the consequence at merge; this catches the cause while the
lane is still working.

No hardware, no other milestone, no decision owed.

## Index row

`helpers/lane-claim-check.sh` misses a claim whose work was pushed to a different branch descending from the claim commit, as in #1460. Proposed: report a pushed branch that contains a claim commit whose pull request head never moved past it.
