# 863. The comment-block sweep continues, worth three

*(Minted 2026-10-09 (UTC) by lane `milestone/863-the-comment-block-sweep-continues` from the proposal `the-comment-block-sweep-continues`. The number is provisional until the merge queue lands it; the title and slug are drafts.)*


Raised 2026-10-09 (UTC) by the lane that built milestone 862 (the comment-block sweep's next
worth), at the end of its worth. §267 (a comment states the constraint as it is now) caps a
comment block at 40 lines. The baseline held 337 rows when milestone 860 (comments state the
constraint as it is now) landed and holds 336
now. One row left entirely: the frame-budget ledger, gone to `notes/frame-budget.md`. Five
banked down (406, 224, 209, 197 and 197 lines, to 301, 201, 171, 164 and 141).

The worst still on it, with their rows: `crates/system_initializer/src/lib.rs:6` (301, held by
its `no_run` doctest, which is a gate and stays), `components/src/timetable.rs:1` (201), then
`crates/glob/src/lib.rs:1` (190), `crates/board_console/src/lib.rs:1` (186), and
`crates/non_volatile_memory_express/src/lib.rs:2` and `crates/component_plan/src/lib.rs:1` (185
each). A worth takes the worst handful that is not a gated example. Each block's history goes to
a commit message, its findings to a note, its naming record to `design/naming/`, and every shrink
is banked. The method, the refused alternatives and the evidence are milestone 860's block and
`notes/comment-cost-2026-10-07.md`.

Reuse: the ratchet, the lexer and the baseline already exist (milestone 860 built them). This
worth only runs the sweep and banks, and takes no new code.

## The worth, 2026-10-09 (UTC): built

Swept and banked: `components/src/timetable.rs:1` 201 to 191 (the slots list stopped restating
`timetable::contract`'s table), `crates/glob/src/lib.rs:1` 190 to 153, `crates/board_console/`
186 to 176, `crates/non_volatile_memory_express/` 186 to 92, and `crates/component_plan/` 185 to
159. Baseline rows held at 336.

Mid-worth, calef amended the method in session (2026-10-09 UTC, recorded in §267): the tree does
not need the full history in document form, and the refusal records the earlier worths
transplanted into `design/naming/` are removed, since git holds them. This worth deleted
`rmle-name-search.md`, `jh7110-entropy-name.md`, `job-mix-name.md` and `component-plan-name.md`,
the NVMe section of `spelled-out-rulings.md`, the `system_initializer` section of `crates.md` and
the `board_console` section of `programs-scripts-and-directories.md`, and pointed each crate's
Name block at git history instead. The accounts are in the commits that wrote them. What stays in
the tree: the rulings with their dates, the rules (the console-marker rule is milestone 297 (`soak` becomes `soak-test`)'s block), the
standing measurements, and the constraints.

## Follow-on

- **Proposed.** `design/roadmap/proposals/the-comment-block-sweep-continues-again.md`: worth four,
  under the amended method: constraint stays, history goes to the commit message and git, no
  transplant documents. Next worst: `jh7110_clock_and_reset` (184), `current_cpu_protocol`
  (183), `login` (178), `jh7110_entropy` (176) and `board_console` (176).

## Index row

The comment-block sweep's third worth: timetable's remainder, glob, board_console, the NVMe crate and component_plan, each shrunk to the constraint as it is now and banked. Mid-worth, calef ruled the tree keeps no history in document form, so the transplanted refusal records went to git.
