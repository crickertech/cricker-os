# 711. §230 records that a plain `SEND` carries its capability's badge

Promoted from `design/roadmap/proposals/section-230-records-that-a-plain-send-carries-its-badge.md` on 2026-10-03 (UTC). The number 711 was minted by the maintainer in a batch promotion of the proposal pile and is provisional until the queue lands it. Status BUILT 2026-10-03: the amendment to DECISIONS §230 landed in PR #1524 (merged 2026-10-03T17:04Z). *(Title and slug are drafts.)*

Raised by the 2026-10-03 security audit
(`design/audit-reports/2026-10-03-eight-constants-and-thirteen-components.md`, finding 1). It is a
record owed, not code. The integrator adds an amendment to §230 (badged endpoint capabilities) at
merge, the way §-sections are minted. This file is retired when the amendment lands.

## What changed on the wire, and where it is written down

Milestone 613 (a system log service: the in-memory half) changed what `RECV` returns in `x3` for an
ordinary message. Before it, `x3` was always `0` for a plain `SEND` and the badge rode only on
`CALL` and `SEND_CAP` (§230's table). Since commit `4feaf0dc2` (2026-10-02), `wide` in
`kernel/src/sched.rs` writes the badge of the capability the sender invoked into word 3, and
`abi::rendezvous::RECV`'s doc says so. calef ruled it on pull request #1494. The block of
milestone 634 (a plain SEND received by RECEIVE_CAP never hands the receiver a sender-chosen slot)
and the risk 7 record both cite "calef's ruling on #1494" as the fix for the second escape
that audit confirmed. In that escape a bound client's plain `SEND` arrived as badge `0`, which
`subtree_scope` reads as root.

So the semantics of a syscall method changed and every program is now written against the new
meaning. The only records are a PR comment, two roadmap blocks and a doc comment in
`crates/abi`. CLAUDE.md's rule for the syscall surface is that each method's semantics are recorded
in `design/decisions/`, not just in code. §230 is where a reader of the badge contract looks.
`grep -n '613\|plain SEND' design/decisions/0230-*.md design/decisions/0242-*.md` finds nothing.

## What the amendment should say

One dated paragraph under §230, in the shape of the correction in §74 (audits run on change, not
on the calendar):

- The badge is delivered on every receive, not only `CALL` and `SEND_CAP`: `RECV` and `RECV_CAP`
  both return it in `x3`, `0` when the capability was unbadged.
- It is the kernel's word on every path. The syscall layer reads it from the capability in the
  caller's table, never from a register the sender filled (`kernel/src/syscall.rs`, the `SEND`
  arm, `sched::ipc_send_badged`).
- The reason: §242 (a system log) stamps every record from the writer's badge, and a byte-sink
  writer speaks a plain `SEND`. Without this the badge a spawner minted was dropped on the one path
  it was minted for.
- The second reason is the confinement one from milestone 634's block. A bound filesystem client
  that `SEND`s rather than `CALL`s on its badged capability arrived as badge `0`, which
  `crates/subtree_scope` reads as an open binding.
- A death message is told apart by its first word, as before. Nothing in the tree reads `x3`
  before checking `x0` (the 2026-10-03 audit read every `recv_fault` caller).

## What it costs

A paragraph. The code, the tests
(`a_plain_send_arrives_with_its_capabilitys_badge_on_recv_and_recv_cap`) and the abi doc are
already on `main`. What is missing is the record a future reader of §230 would act on.

## What is blocked until it lands

Nothing in code. The risk is the next lane that reads §230's table and sees `SEND` without a
badge. It could write a server that treats a non-zero `x3` on `RECV` as a fault message or a
corruption, as the pre-613 contract allowed.

## Follow-on

- **Done.** The amendment to DECISIONS §230 (badged endpoint capabilities) recording the badge on a plain `SEND`, landed in PR #1524.

## Index row

Milestone 613 changed what `RECV` returns in `x3` for a plain `SEND`, and the only records were a pull request comment, two roadmap blocks and a doc comment. Owed: an amendment to DECISIONS §230 (badged endpoint capabilities) recording it.
