# 865. The comment-block sweep continues a third time, worth five

Raised 2026-10-10 (UTC) by the lane that built milestone 864 (the comment-block sweep continues
again, worth four); minted from the proposal of the same name. §267 (a comment states the constraint as it is now) caps a comment block at
40 lines. Its 2026-10-09 amendment rules the method: the constraint stays, history goes to the
commit message and git, and no narrative is transplanted into a document.

The baseline holds 336 rows. The worst after worth four:
`components/src/timetable.rs:1` (191), `components/src/login.rs:1` (177),
`crates/current_cpu_protocol/src/lib.rs:1` (176), `components/src/system_installer.rs:1` (175)
and `crates/board_console/src/lib.rs:1` (173). A worth
takes the worst handful that is not a gated example, and every shrink is banked. The method, the
refused alternatives and the evidence are milestone 860 (comments state the constraint as it
is now)'s block and `notes/comment-cost-2026-10-07.md`.

Reuse: the ratchet, the lexer and the baseline already exist (milestone 860 built them). This
worth only runs the sweep and banks, and takes no new code.

## Index row

Worth five of the comment-block sweep: the worst five over-cap blocks shrunk to their constraints and banked, history to commit messages and git, no transplant documents.
