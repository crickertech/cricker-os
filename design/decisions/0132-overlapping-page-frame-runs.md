# 132. What `PageFrame::REVOKE` owes an overlapping run

calef, 2026-08-27: option C for questions 1 and 2, built rather than
deferred; question 3 (the device half) stays open. Raised the same day by milestone 142's lane, out
of the adversarial security review of DECISIONS §102's build. **The section number is provisional**: a lane does not mint one,
and the integrator renumbers this at merge like every other global name. Cited from
`kernel/src/revoke.rs`'s `revoke_page_frame_run` BUGS section, `kernel/src/sched.rs`'s
`delete_page_frame_caps`, and notes/frames.md.

The body below is left as it was written, options priced and lean stated, because a decision
record that edits away the argument it was decided against is worth less than the argument. What
changed is the last section: see [How it was decided, and what shipped](#how-it-was-decided-and-what-shipped).

Nothing was blocked by this. What was blocked is the first `Rights::GRANT` on a run capability:
`PageFrame::REVOKE` requires `GRANT` (`kernel/src/syscall.rs`), no run capability in the tree
carries it, and so no path below was reachable. That is the whole reason this was a written decision
rather than a fix: the fix was unreachable and the wrong one is expensive.

## What is being decided

§102 gave `Object::PageFrame` a page count, so one capability names a run. It said `REVOKE`
"unmaps it from every address space and deletes every capability to it", and it did not say what
"every capability to it" means when two capabilities name overlapping but unequal runs, because
when it was written no two capabilities could overlap.

Three questions, and they separate cleanly:

1. Which capabilities does `REVOKE` delete? Only the object invoked (today), or every
   capability whose run intersects it?
2. Which mappings does `REVOKE` unmap? Every address space that maps the physical page (today,
   `unmap_everywhere`), or only the mappings made under the capability being revoked?
3. What does `REVOKE` owe a device? Nothing today: revocation is a CPU-side operation and the
   driver's IOMMU/DMA window still covers the run.

## Is the premise true

Yes, checked rather than argued. Three capabilities over overlapping physical memory exist in the
tree's own display wiring today (`kernel/src/user/display_service.rs`, where `surface = dma +
FRAME_SIZE`):

| holder | slot | object |
|---|---|---|
| gpu driver | `DRIVER_SLOT_DMA` | `PageFrame(dma, 312)` |
| painting client | `CLIENT_SLOT_SURFACE` | `PageFrame(dma + 4096, 311)` |
| display terminal | `TERM_SLOT_SURFACE` | `PageFrame(dma + 4096, 311)` |

and a fourth in `compositor_service.rs`, where a capture client holds the same 311-page run
read-only as the compositor's `screen`. **This is deliberate, not a bug**: the driver's capability
has to cover the whole DMA window it registers with the IOMMU (`virtio::register(.., dma,
DMA_PAGE_FRAMES * FRAME_SIZE, ..)`), and the clients' has to start one page in, past the control
page they have no business touching. The overlap is what "the driver scans out the client's
surface" *means* on this path.

None of the four carries `Rights::GRANT` (three are `READ | WRITE`, one is `READ`), which is
what makes every option below unreachable today.

## What the tree already does in the analogous case

- `revoke_device_from_others` (DECISIONS §41) is the one revocation that is already selective,
  and it is selective by *holder*, not by capability: it spares the invoker and takes everyone
  else. Its doc says out loud that this is "one level of the capability-derivation tree §13
  deferred, and only one".
- The mapping log carries no capability identity. `revoke::LogEntry` is `{ phys, va }` and
  nothing else, and §102 explicitly kept it that way ("the revocation table is per-page, not
  per-capability, and that doesn't change"). So question 2 cannot be answered at all without
  changing that record's shape.
- `delete_page_frame_caps_overlapping` (added by this same review pass, `kernel/src/sched.rs`)
  already answers question 1 with "overlap" *for reclamation*, because reclamation had no choice:
  the pages go back to an allocator that hands them out again, so a surviving capability is §13's
  use-after-free. That is a different question from `REVOKE`'s, and it is answered differently on
  purpose.

## Prior art

seL4 keeps a full capability-derivation tree and a mapping database in which a frame mapping is
associated with the frame capability that made it, so revoking a capability revokes its own
mappings and its derivatives' and nothing else. This kernel deliberately kept neither (§13's
deferral), and §102 chose "fewer, fatter capabilities" for a fixed-size capability table where
seL4's radix tree would let it hold more of them. Stated from recollection of seL4's design
rather than from a reading of its manual in this pass, per this project's rule about claims from
memory; the shape of the argument does not depend on the details.

## The options, priced

### A. Leave it, record it (what the tree does now)

`REVOKE` deletes the exact object it was invoked on; the unmap stays space-blind.

Cost: zero. Consequence: revoking the terminal's 311-page run unmaps those physical pages
out of the *driver's* address space too, under a capability nobody revoked, and leaves the driver's
`PageFrame(dma, 312)` in place naming pages it can immediately re-map. So the revoke is
simultaneously too strong (it reached a space it was not aimed at) and too weak (it left an
overlapping capability holding authority). Neither is a use-after-free, because `REVOKE` reclaims
nothing: a region is spend-only, so the pages are still the region's.

### B. Overlap-scoped `REVOKE`

Make `REVOKE` use `delete_page_frame_caps_overlapping` too, so it deletes every capability whose
run intersects the invoked one.

Cost: one line, and it makes `REVOKE` and `DESTROY` agree. Consequence: it contradicts
§102's own text, which contemplates two capabilities coexisting over sub-ranges of one region ("if
a future consumer needs it, it can hold two capabilities: `Frame(phys, 401)` and `Frame(phys + 401
* 4096, 74)`"). Under B, revoking either destroys the other. It also lets a holder of a
one-page run delete a 312-page capability by naming any page inside it, which is an authority a
one-page capability should not have.

### C. Capability-scoped revocation

Record which capability made each mapping, and have `REVOKE` unmap only those. This is the answer
to both questions 1 and 2, and it is the seL4 shape.

Cost, measured rather than asserted. `LogEntry` grows from 16 bytes to 24 to carry the object
(`phys, va` plus the run base, which identifies the capability, derivatives included, since
`derive` never changes the object). `LOG_ENTRIES` falls from 255 to 170 per log page, so a space
pays about 1.5x the log pages it pays now; `revoke.rs`'s existing
`assert!(size_of::<LogPage>() == FRAME_SIZE)` keeps that honest at compile time. "Or its
derivatives" is free under this encoding and only under it: a narrowed derivative has the same
object, so matching on the object matches the whole family without §13's derivation tree.

Consequence: it does not close the device half (question 3), and it is a change to what
`REVOKE` means, which is the syscall surface.

### D. Forbid overlapping runs at mint time

Refuse to mint a run capability overlapping an existing one, so the question cannot arise.

This loses on the premise, and that is worth recording rather than leaving as an intuition. The
tree's display path *requires* the overlap: the driver's capability must span the IOMMU window it
registered and the clients' must start one page in. D would mean redesigning that wiring (a
separate control-page capability, a DMA registration decoupled from the frame capability) to buy a
property nothing currently needs. It is a real option only if the overlap is judged to be the
mistake, and the wiring's own reasoning says it is not.

## The device half, which none of the options above touch

`PageFrame::REVOKE` is a CPU-side operation. The gpu driver registers `[dma, dma + 312 * 4096)`
with `virtio::register`, and that window is what the DMA validator and the IOMMU domain check
against; it is not derived from any capability and revoking one does not narrow it. So a
capability-perfect revocation of the surface still leaves the device able to write those pages
until the driver's virtio registration is itself torn down. Whether `REVOKE` should narrow a DMA
window is a separate question from all of the above, and it is the one with the most surface: it
would couple two objects (`PageFrame` and `Virtio`) that are deliberately independent today.

## Recommendation (as written, before the decision)

A now, C when it becomes reachable, and the reachability is the trigger. This is a
syscall-surface question, so per AGENTS.md it arrives with options rather than a made decision; the
lean is stated as a lean.

A is right today because every option costs something and no option buys anything: nothing can
invoke `REVOKE` on a run. B is cheap and wrong (it contradicts §102 and hands a one-page holder
authority over a 312-page capability). C is the honest answer and costs a log-format change plus a
syscall-semantics decision, which is a lot to spend on an unreachable path.

The promotion trigger, in §71's shape: the moment any `page_frame_run_cap` mint site gains
`Rights::GRANT`, this decision must be answered before that change lands. That is one grep
(`git grep -n page_frame_run_cap`) and it is the condition under which A stops being honest and
starts being a hole.

## What was blocked until this was answered

Nothing in flight. Specifically **not** blocked: milestone 142, the scanout, or any current
`PageFrame` work. Blocked: granting `GRANT` on any run capability, and therefore any future
design that wants a run to be delegable or revocable by its holder. That is now unblocked.

## How it was decided, and what shipped

**calef asked "why not C now?" and the deferral did not survive the question** (2026-08-27). The
recommendation above is a worked instance of the failure AGENTS.md names in *elegance and
performance beat implementation convenience*: a case made in the vocabulary of architecture
("unreachable path", "syscall-semantics decision") whose load-bearing clause was that A was less
work. Applied to itself, the tenet's one question, *would I still choose this if both options were
the same amount of work*, answers no. C wins outright on the merits, and the cost that made
deferring look prudent turned out to be small and bounded.

Three things the argument turned on, and they are lookups rather than opinions.

Every live `REVOKE` call site is single-page, so C changes nothing observable today. Not
asserted, traced. There are four, and the earlier count of three missed one:

| Site | Object | Path |
|---|---|---|
| `fixtures/src/hello.rs`'s `revoke_demo` | `PageFrame(phys, 1)` from `MemoryRegion::RETYPE`, `Rights::ALL` | the only production `PageFrame::REVOKE` in the tree, driven end to end by `a_process_revokes_a_frame_and_loses_the_capability` |
| `components/src/swapper.rs`'s device hand-back | `DeviceFrame(phys)` | `revoke_device_from_others`, §41, untouched by this work |
| `kernel/src/user/disk_tests.rs` | `PageFrame(roster_phys, 1)` from `page_frame_cap` | `revoke::revoke_page_frame` directly |
| `kernel/src/user/tests.rs` | one page, mapped with no capability at all | `revoke::revoke_page_frame` directly |

For a single-page object, capability identity and physical overlap are the same test: two *different*
one-page capabilities cannot overlap without being equal. All four still pass on all three
architectures, unchanged, which is the empirical half of the claim rather than the reasoning half.

The cost is one word per mapping record. `LogEntry` went from 16 bytes to 24 and `LOG_ENTRIES`
from 255 to 170 per log page (`16 + 24 * 170 == 4096`), so a space pays about 1.5x the log pages it
paid. The pricing in the option above was right. `revoke.rs`'s `assert!(size_of::<LogPage>() ==
FRAME_SIZE)` holds it to account at compile time, and that was verified by setting `LOG_ENTRIES` to
171 and watching it fail rather than by trusting the arithmetic.

"Or its derivatives" really is free. `Cap::derive` narrows rights and never changes the object,
so the run's base address matches the whole derivation family with no §13 derivation tree. One word,
not two.

What shipped, on `milestone/132-capability-scoped-revocation`:

- `revoke::LogEntry` carries the object each mapping was made under, and `revoke::record_mapping`
  takes a required `PageMapSource` (ratified 2026-08-27, landed as `MappedUnder`; renamed since
  "mapping" alone is overloaded across this tree and `pmap` is already this tree's word for a page
  mapping) saying which capability that was, or `NoCapability` for a page nothing names. A required
  argument with no default is the ladder's rung one: a mapping that cannot say what authority made
  it no longer compiles.
- `PageFrame::REVOKE`'s unmap half is scoped to that object (`revoke::unmap_under_object`);
  `revoke_page_frame` is now literally the `count: 1` case of `revoke_page_frame_run`.
- The capability half is unchanged, because exact-object equality already *was* the derivation
  family. Question 1's answer under C is the code that was already there.
- Reclamation (`revoke_region`) and the device take-back (`revoke_device_from_others`) stay
  object-blind, each with the reason written where a reader meets it: reclamation asks whether the
  page is safe to hand out again, and the take-back scopes by holder rather than by capability.
- Two tests: `revoking_one_run_leaves_an_overlapping_capability_and_its_mappings_alone` (the display
  wiring's shape, shrunk to four pages; it fails on the old space-blind unmap, which was checked by
  reverting the one line) and `a_device_take_back_ignores_the_object_and_spares_one_holder` (§41's
  regression guard, two holders recording one page under deliberately different objects).

This amends one sentence of §102, which said "the revocation table is per-page, not
per-capability, and that doesn't change." It changed. The table is still keyed per page; it now also
records which object authorized each entry.

**Question 3 is not answered and is not made easier by this.** `PageFrame::REVOKE` is still a
CPU-side operation, a driver's IOMMU/DMA window is still registered as a byte range derived from no
capability, and a capability-perfect revocation still leaves the device able to write the pages until
the virtio registration is torn down. Coupling `PageFrame` and `Virtio`, which are independent by
design, is a separate decision with more surface than this one had. Recorded in `revoke.rs`'s
`revoke_page_frame_run` BUGS and in notes/frames.md, where a reader meets the feature.
