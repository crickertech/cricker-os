# §139's appendices

[`../0139-cycle-counter-authority.md`](../0139-cycle-counter-authority.md) is the page to read. It
holds the ruling, the options and the recommendation, and a reader can act on it without opening
anything here. calef ruled on 2026-10-11 (UTC) that the decision is split under §212 (a prose
budget) rather than given an exception, and the maintainer moved its evidence into these files:

- [`premise-checks.md`](premise-checks.md): the four findings that made the premise of milestone 75 (who
  may read the cycle counter) half false.
- [`x86-clock-sources.md`](x86-clock-sources.md): the check that `x86_64` has one user-readable
  clock, and the scope note for its row.
- [`trap-and-emulate.md`](trap-and-emulate.md): what trapping `rdtsc` costs, measured on cordoba.
- [`prior-art.md`](prior-art.md): seL4, Linux and L4Re, and the two-thread clock.

*Name: provisional, minted 2026-10-11 (UTC) by the maintainer on `maintainer/split-decision-0139`,
for the directory and every stem in it. The directory follows §212's parent-named default. Naming
is calef's; `script/names --unratified` lists each stem.*
