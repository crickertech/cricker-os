# 239. Four package kinds, and TOML for package declarations and recipes

*Section number provisional until the merge queue lands it.*

Raised on pull request #1396, milestone 611 (every program and crate belongs to a package, and
every package has a home). It built the package-boundary lint against the existing `.package` and
`.recipe` formats, and left two questions open: what format a package declaration and a recipe are
written in, and how many kinds of package there are.

calef ruled both in comments on #1396, the same session. He also ruled a third thing about #1396
itself, with no PR comment to cite.

## Land the PR now

calef said "Yes" to landing #1396 now, at approximately 2026-09-27T06:30Z. There is no PR comment
recording this: it was said in the maintainer session that briefed this lane. This section is
where it is written down (CLAUDE.md, "a note, a report, or a comment on a pull request" is the
floor rung for a fact that would otherwise exist only in that session).

## The format: TOML

calef ruled at 2026-09-27T07:00Z: package declarations and recipes both move to TOML. His words:
*"Move both to toml."* JSON was refused for having no comments. YAML was refused for its ambiguity,
and for how it handles dependencies: a YAML anchor/alias graph reads as a dependency list without
being one.

This PR (#1396) lands as it already was. A follow-up (built in #1405) converts `packages/*.package`
to `packages/<name>.package.toml`, `packages/homes` to `packages/homes.toml`, and
`packages/*.recipe` to `packages/*.recipe.toml`. It also gives `xtask` the `toml` crate as a
host-only dependency, which §46 (thin primitives or whole subsystems) governs and §240 (`toml` in
`xtask`) records. The file extensions are provisional.

## The four kinds, and what each buys

calef ratified the four package kinds at 2026-09-27T07:23Z: `base`, `optional`, `sdk` and `test`.
The rule: **a package's kind says where it ends up.**

| Kind | Destination |
|---|---|
| `base` | every image |
| `optional` | installable on a device |
| `sdk` | a developer's machine (the S2 archive) |
| `test` | nowhere outside CI |

A new kind has to name a new destination. A kind that does not change where a package lands is not
a new kind: it is a `base` or `optional` package that happens to be used differently. The S2
archive is the slot layout of §235 (the OS is built and updated from packages, and the tree
divides by what releases together).

## Reversibility

The format change is mechanical and reversible while nothing outside the tree reads these files.
`helpers/packages.py`'s selftest plants violations and checks that the parser refuses a misspelt
key, which is the gate that would catch a bad migration. The four kinds are closer to the naming
category (CLAUDE.md, "move fast on what can be undone"): cheap to add a fifth kind later, expensive
to rename one that packages already declare themselves against.
