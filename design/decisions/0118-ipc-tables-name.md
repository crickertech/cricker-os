# 118. `Scheduler`/`SCHED` rename to `IpcTables`/`IPC_TABLES`

calef, 2026-08-23, on milestone 98 (name what `SCHED` actually guards)'s naming fork: *"Agreed, go with
IpcTables."*

## The question

`Scheduler` (the type) and `SCHED` (the static) hold a thread table and an endpoint registry.
Neither the run queue nor `current` live there any more (both moved to per-CPU storage, §11 steps
3a/3b); what's left is genuinely whole-machine but is not scheduling state. The module `sched`
keeps its name correctly (`schedule()`, preemption, and round-robin policy all live there and all
genuinely schedule); the type and the static do not, and milestone 98 named the mismatch without
picking a replacement, deliberately reserving the call for calef.

## The decision

`Scheduler` becomes `IpcTables`; `SCHED` becomes `IPC_TABLES`. The module keeps `sched`.

## Why, and why not the alternatives considered first

Milestone 98's own doc had already ruled out `ObjectRegistry` (claims more generality than the type
has: there are two kinds held, not any kind) and `Objects` (too vague, exactly what DECISIONS §39
warns a generic word does). `IpcState` was proposed and considered next but rejected for the same
underlying weakness one level down: "state" says *that* IPC-relevant data lives here without saying
*what*, so a reader still has to open the file to learn it's a thread table and an endpoint
registry. Milestone 98's own instruction is explicit -- "Propose with what it holds, and wait"
-- which is a naming rule, not a suggestion: name the type for its concrete contents, the pattern
already used this session for `AddressSpace`, `MemoryRegion`, `ThreadControlBlock`. `IpcTables`
passes that test where `IpcState` does not: it says, correctly, that there are tables (plural)
inside, and a reader expects to find exactly what is there.

The `Ipc` half is not invented for this decision; it is already this tree's own finding.
`notes/sched-lock-inventory.md` classified every `SCHED.lock()` call site by reading, not
guessing, and its conclusion is on record: "The hot set is IPC." The oddity milestone 98 names
(`grant`/`current_cap`/`delete_current_cap` taking the scheduler lock for no reason connected to
scheduling) stops being a puzzle under this name: cspaces live inside thread-table entries, and
thread-table lookups are IPC's business, so of course IPC-shaped operations take this lock.

Checked for collisions: `crates/ipc` already exists and holds `Endpoint`, `Send`, `Recv` -- nothing
named `Tables` or `State`, so no clash with the new name.

## Prior art, checked rather than recalled

Mach uses this exact term for the analogous structure: each task's port namespace is called its
**"IPC table"**, backed by a per-task `ipc_space`, mapping port names to the ports and rights a task
holds. Apple's Kernel Programming Guide and the GNU Mach reference manual both describe the
mechanism; a process's port lookup table is documented plainly as its "IPC table."

**The match is on the word and the concept, not on scope, and that difference is worth keeping
rather than glossing over.** Mach's IPC table is *per-task*; `IpcTables` here is deliberately
*whole-machine*, which is the exact property milestone 98's own text calls out ("the thread table
and the endpoints... genuinely whole-machine"). The precedent supports the vocabulary -- a kernel
table resolving names into the objects an IPC-capable syscall needs is a real, named thing in the
field -- not a claim that this tree copied Mach's per-task design.

## What this does not decide

The exact rename mechanics (order of edits, whether `notes/sched-lock-inventory.md` gets renamed in
the same commit or a following one) are milestone 98's own scope note's to follow, not this entry's:
that note already specifies pure rename, no behaviour change, milestone 69's proof obligation
applies, the lock rank keeps its position, and the type/static must be renamed together in one
commit ("do not do half of it").

## What it unblocks

Milestone 98 can now be built: `kernel/src/sched.rs`'s `Scheduler` type and `SCHED` static become
`IpcTables`/`IPC_TABLES`, the module path is unchanged, and `notes/sched-lock-inventory.md` follows
the code once the rename lands.
