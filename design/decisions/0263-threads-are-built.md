# 263. Threads are built: more than one thread in an address space

*Section number provisional until the merge queue lands it; 259 (PR #1847) and 261 (PR #1840) were
in flight and lane/standard-benchmarks was recording a ruling when this was written, so 262 was left
to it. Recorded by lane/threads-and-fork for the maintainer on 2026-10-08 (UTC).*

## The ruling

§105 (`std::thread::spawn` stays declined, until a customer needs it) declined threads, and its
2026-10-07 amendment reopened it for read-write ZFS without scheduling it. calef, 2026-10-08 (UTC):

> We should do threads. We deferred them because we didn't have a use. Now we've backed up uses.

So §105's condition is met, and this section supersedes it. Option A of
[`notes/thread-spawn-fork.md`](../../notes/thread-spawn-fork.md) is to be built: several threads,
each its own TCB, sharing one address space. Milestone 812 (`std::thread::spawn` runs real threads
in one address space) is the build, and it is now scheduled work rather than a parked block.

## The uses that are waiting

Each is a stranger's program or a benchmark the field already reads:

- `fio`, for risk 6 (a confined driver at real speed) and for risk 1 (only software written for
  nife runs on nife). It runs jobs as threads and keeps its own clock thread.
- `schbench` and `hackbench`'s thread mode, for risk 5 (not reliable on multicore). They measure
  wakeups between threads of one process, which nife cannot host today.
- `iperf3` 3.16 and later, which is multithreaded.
- `ripgrep`'s parallel walk, risk 1's third gap. Its threads have never run, because nife answers
  `available_parallelism()` with `Ok(1)`.
- Read-write ZFS through `libzpool`, `tough`, and parallel `rustc` and `cargo`, which §105's
  amendment already listed.

## What this decides, and what it leaves open

It decides that threads exist, on aarch64, riscv64 and x86_64 together (§19 (architectural parity is
a tenet)). It does not decide the syscall shape. Binding a space without consuming it changes what
`Tcb::CONFIGURE` promises, and a wait/wake primitive is new surface, so each owes a ruling before
code (§10 (process model: capability-based, microkernel) keeps the syscall surface narrow).
Milestone 812's block lists those forks with options and a recommendation for each.

## What it changes in other sections

- §105 is superseded. Its costing stays the starting point.
- §249 (a running address space stays nameable, and a capability never decides when it dies),
  amendment (b), refuses a second bind of a bound space and says §105 rests on that refusal. The
  refusal has to become a permission that can be granted, which is milestone 812's first fork.
- §22 (Rust `std` on the native ABI, the Hermit way) set `"singlethread": true` in the three target
  specifications and said it "flips off when `thread::spawn` becomes real". Milestone 812 flips it.
- §33 (the compositor's authority is memory, not messages) recorded the constraint as a structural
  fact: two threads cannot share an address space, so a process has one blocking wait point. Ten
  comments in `components/` and `crates/user_mode_runtime` cite §33 for that fact to justify a
  `static mut` or a shared page. The fact stops holding for any program that starts a second thread,
  so each site is a work item in milestone 812. §33's own reasoning about wait-any is unchanged,
  since §101 (notification objects) answered that separately.
