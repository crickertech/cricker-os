# The documentation standard is FreeBSD's

*Appendix to [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md), which carries the rules: task-oriented, in-tree, real
`EXAMPLES`, an honest `BUGS` section beside the feature. This file carries why that standard was
chosen and what each of its four parts buys. Moved here 2026-09-23 (UTC) on calef's authorization,
unchanged in substance.*

The standard to aim at is FreeBSD's (calef, 2026-07-30): the Handbook and the man pages, which
are the best documentation in the field and are the reason a FreeBSD admin can answer a question
without leaving the system. Four things make them that, and all four are things we can do:

- Task-oriented. "How do I do X", in order, with the actual commands, rather than a reference
  dump the reader has to reassemble.
- In-tree and versioned with the code, so the docs cannot describe a system that no longer
  exists. Already true here; keep it true.
- Real `EXAMPLES`. A page without a worked example has not finished explaining itself.
- An honest `BUGS` section. FreeBSD man pages document known limitations *in the manual*, next
  to the feature, rather than only in a tracker. This is the one worth copying hardest, because it
  is the convention this project already reaches for by instinct: the map "tie", the spawn caveat,
  the scope notes on parity gaps. **Name the limitation where the reader meets the feature.** When a
  limitation graduates from record to plan, and what forces the graduation, is the convention of
  §71 (a limitation is promoted when it becomes a plan): a `BUGS` entry is a fact, a roadmap row is
  intent, and the promotion triggers are listed there.

The point is not the format, which is theirs. It is the posture: documentation written for someone
who has to *use* the thing, and honest enough that they trust it when it says something works.
