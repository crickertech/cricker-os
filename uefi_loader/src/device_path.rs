//! **Is this file on that disk?** The one device-path question the loader asks (the live stick
//! proposal's G1, `design/roadmap/0773-a-live-stick.md`).
//!
//! A UEFI device path is a run of nodes, each `type: u8, subtype: u8, length: u16` (little-endian,
//! header included) and then its data, ending in the end-of-entire-path node (type `0x7F`, subtype
//! `0xFF`). A partition's path is its disk's path with one more node on the end, the `HARDDRIVE`
//! node, so **"is this partition on that disk" is "does the disk's path, without its end node, begin
//! the partition's"**. That a child handle's path is its parent's with nodes appended is recalled
//! from the UEFI specification rather than re-read; what was measured is OVMF doing it, in boot 3 of
//! `cargo xtask install-boot`.
//!
//! Comparing bytes is enough because every node carries its own length: two paths whose first `n`
//! bytes are equal have the same first nodes, cut at the same boundaries. Nothing here decodes a
//! node, which is why it is a dozen lines rather than the device-path parser the chooser's `BUGS`
//! once said it wanted.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A firmware that builds a partition's path some other way** (a vendor node in the middle, a
//!   `MESSAGING` node rewritten between the disk and its partitions) would make every disk look
//!   foreign. The loader then boots the image in its own file and boots no slot, which is the safe
//!   direction: an installed machine on such a firmware would lose its rollback, not its boot.
//!   OVMF builds them the specified way; no other firmware has been measured.
