//! Fuzz a stub resolver's reply checks with arbitrary bytes as the reply.
//!
//! **Why this target exists.** `crates/domain_name_system` reads what a name server sends back, and
//! anyone who can forge a reply chooses those bytes. Milestone 384 (in a capability system the
//! resolver is a grant) puts the resolver on the path of every connection made by name, so a reply
//! that panics the parser takes name resolution down, and one that slips an address past
//! `Query::accept` sends a client to the wrong host. The Kani harnesses prove the name decoder and
//! the TCP reassembly on small inputs; this target covers `accept` itself, which is too large for
//! the solver.
//!
//! The input is the reply, raw, so the real captures in `crates/domain_name_system/tests/fixtures`
//! seed it unmodified (`script/fuzz` passes that directory read-only). The query is built from the
//! reply's own id and question where they parse, so a mutation reaches the answer section instead of
//! dying on the id check every time.
//!
//! **What is asserted, beyond "it returned":**
//!
//! 1. **An accepted address is really there.** Every address `accept` hands back is the data of a
//!    class-IN A record in the answer section, owned by the name `accept` reports as canonical, and
//!    that name is ours or is reached from ours by a CNAME in the same section. This is the property
//!    a poisoning bug violates, checked by a second, independent walk of the message. Falsified on
//!    2026-10-04: with `accept`'s owner check deleted, so that any A record in the answer counts,
//!    this assertion fired inside a two-minute run starting from the three real captures.
//! 2. **TCP framing does not change the bytes.** The reply framed for TCP and fed in pieces of one,
//!    three and all bytes comes back whole and identical, and a buffer one byte too small refuses it.
//! 3. **The name decoder is total at every offset**, with its resume offset inside the message.
