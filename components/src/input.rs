//! Console **input**, at EL0: the raw receive driver (milestone 19f.4, raw since milestone 28).
//!
//! The receive half of a terminal, reduced to what a driver actually is: own the UART's receive
//! side and its interrupt, and forward every byte that arrives. It assembles nothing, echoes
//! nothing, and interprets nothing; the editing, echo, and line assembly that used to live here
//! moved to the line discipline component (`line_editor`), where Unix keeps them too (a UART driver
//! feeds the tty layer; it is not the tty layer). What remains is the irreducible driver loop:
//! WAIT on the interrupt, drain the FIFO, hand the bytes on, ACK.
//!
//! Bytes travel packed in the words of an `OPERATION_BYTES` CALL (up to 8 per message, the terminal
//! contract's driver half; see notes/terminal-contract.md). A keystroke is one byte and control
//! flow, not bulk data, so the words-in-registers path fits §10's rule; a paste drains in
//! 8-byte messages, and the CALL's rendezvous is the flow control that keeps a fast sender from
//! outrunning the discipline.
//!
//! Its whole authority: WRITE on the terminal endpoint (slot 0), the RX interrupt capability (slot
//! 1), and the device the machine gives it. On aarch64/riscv64 that is the UART registers mapped
//! device-typed; **on x86 (milestone 299 (the x86 port-range capability: the serial console
//! becomes a userspace driver)) it is a `PortRange` capability for COM1's ports** (slot 2), which
//! the TSS I/O bitmap reads rather than this program invoking it. It cannot print, spawn, or read
//! what anyone else typed. No role selector; the syscall runtime comes from
//! `user_mode_runtime`.
//!
//! The arch-specific part is the UART register layout, in the `uart` module below (aarch64 PL011,
//! RISC-V NS16550 by memory, x86 16550 by port I/O). The loop is one `_start` on all three: x86's
//! polled twin went with milestone 505 (an x86_64 input driver that never lets the core idle).
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-07-30 (calef, DECISIONS §39), among the names recorded there as always
//! right.
