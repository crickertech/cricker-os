//! **`uptime`**: print how long the machine has been counting (milestone 126 (the `procps` package),
//! design/roadmap/0126-who-else-is-running.md, notes/process-view.md).
//!
//! The whole program is: read the ambient monotonic counter, hand the nanoseconds to
//! [`uptime::format`], send the bytes. It holds one capability (the output sink) and cannot
//! change anything: the counter is granted to every process unconditionally, so the manifest is
//! `least_authority_demo`'s. The finding (milestone 126 (the `procps` package) assumed this
//! wanted kernel-side accounting; it did not) is recorded in the process-view note's
//! machine-statistics appendix, notes/process-view/the-machine-and-your-share.md, moved there
//! 2026-10-09 (UTC).
//!
//! # Capability contract
//!
//! | slot | what | why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | the output sink, `WRITE` | where the one line goes |
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//! $ uptime
//! up 00:12:34
//! $ uptime > when.txt
//! $ caps uptime
//!   uptime would grant the new process, and nothing else:
//!     cap 0  endpoint  result   report its answer back
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! See `crates/uptime`'s module docs: no load average, no logged-in-user count, one-second
//! resolution, and the counter's own zero predates this kernel's init by an unmeasured amount.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-13 (calef, working the unratified worklist), with `crates/uptime` in
//! one ruling, which is what the crate-and-program pair means. See that crate's module docs
//! for the argument and the refusals.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
