//! **The `e1000e` data plane inside `net_stack`** (milestone 494 (a driver for the network card a PC
//! actually has); notes/e1000e.md).
//!
//! The volatile shell around `crates/e1000e`'s [`DataPlane`]: two windows and a barrier. The ring
//! logic, the descriptor formats and the judgement of every word the device writes are in the
//! crate, host-tested against a simulated device; this file is only the accesses the crate cannot
//! make for itself. The kernel already reset the device, read its MAC address and set both ring
//! bases (`kernel/src/e1000e.rs`); what is mapped here, and what is not, is
//! `kernel/src/user/e1000e_service.rs`'s header.
//!
//! A `#[path]` module of `net_stack` beside `virtio_net_transport.rs`, which is milestone 494's
//! recommendation: the driver runs in the process that runs the stack, as virtio-net does. A
//! separate driver process would put a NIC parser and a TCP stack in different address spaces, and
//! the block records that at equal cost that would be preferred; the reason it is not done here is
//! effort (a frame protocol two programs agree on), said in those words.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Polled.** No interrupt is granted (the service's header says why), so a wait for a frame is
//!   a sleep of [`POLL_MS`] between looks at the ring. Latency is up to that much worse than the
//!   virtio server's on an idle link; nothing polls while no request is being served.
//! - **A full transmit ring drops the frame** after a bounded wait, and the stack above retransmits.
//!   The virtio transport makes the same trade.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-10-06 (calef, "Yes", in conversation). A network card transport is
//! `<device family>_transport`, as `virtio_net_transport` beside it in the same binary; the family
//! is qualified only when its name covers more than one kind of device, as Synopsys's does. Refused
//! `intel_e1000e_transport` and `e1000e_ethernet_transport` (nothing else is called e1000e; Linux
//! names the driver `e1000e` and puts the vendor in the directory; vendors rebrand while family
//! names stay). The vendor, Intel, is recorded here and in `crates/e1000e`'s header instead.
