//! **The login service: authentication produces capabilities** (milestone 49,
//! design/roadmap/0049-users-and-attribution.md, §109 (attribution is a channel property)). Unix
//! login authenticates and then mutates a global identity field, which is uid's whole trick and
//! the thing this system refuses to have: this process authenticates a presented identity against
//! the credential service milestone 56 (secrets and credentials) built, and on success hands back **a capability set**
//! instead, a fresh directory, a fresh budget, a **logout ticket** (see "Reclaiming a session"
//! below) and, when it is free, **the terminal** (see "The terminal: single-session, deny
//! cleanly" below). It is the powerbox pattern with the human at one end, deciding at run time
//! what `crates/system_initializer` used to bake in at build time. The design argument, and the
//! history of every resolved item, are in notes/login.md and notes/login/ (moved there
//! 2026-10-09 UTC by milestone 860 (comments state the constraint as it is now), comments state the constraint as it is now, §267 (a comment
//! states the constraint as it is now)). The constraints, as they are now:
//!
//! - A successful login **builds** a fresh `fs_subtree_caretaker` per principal, the same
//!   construction `crates/system_initializer` performs for a directory-granted spawn, never a
//!   narrowed copy of a shared endpoint: two logins are two endpoint *objects*,
//!   distinguishable, independently revocable, each nameable only by the principal that
//!   established it, which is §109's channel-shaped attribution (the anti-pattern it refuses is
//!   named there three times over).
//! - The front door ([`REQUEST`]/[`RESULT`]) answers exactly one word per client,
//!   [`login_protocol::CONNECT`]: [`connect`] mints a private request/result pair and staging
//!   page, delegated to exactly that caller, and the identity and secret travel only on that
//!   private pair, so concurrent clients contend for order, never for each other's secret
//!   (`login_protocol`'s module docs have the two-phase exchange).
//!   [`login_protocol::LOGOUT`] is the front door's only other word.
//! - A session may run unvouched bytes only when its identity is on the owner's list
//!   ([`login_protocol::RUN_UNVOUCHED_LIST`], empty by default; §219 (how the shell names an installed program to the spawner) gate D2, §221 ruling 2):
//!   the run-unvouched capability, when the spawner placed one at [`RUN_UNVOUCHED`] (the
//!   progenitor does), is delegated `WRITE` with no `GRANT`, per session, from a file the owner
//!   writes and no session can reach ([`listed`]). No session holds a spawn endpoint to use it
//!   with yet, so it is delivered and proven (`kernel::user::login_tests`), not exercised.
//! - Each identity is attenuated to the subtree named by the identity string itself (§117 (a principal's subtree is named by its identity string), no
//!   lookup table), which `identity_provisioner` (milestone 155 (a provisioning tool)) must already have provisioned;
//!   this program never creates one. An authenticated identity with no subtree is refused,
//!   folded into [`login_protocol::DENIED`] indistinguishably from a wrong password.
//!
//! # Reclaiming a session
//!
//! The fourth delegated capability is [`mint`]'s own construction `region`, undropped and
//! narrowed to `WRITE` (the one right `MemoryRegion::DESTROY` needs): the client's **logout
//! ticket**, whose only remaining use is `DESTROY`, which reclaims the caretaker's TCB, address
//! space and endpoints; the pages come home to [`CONSTRUCTION_UT`] under §13 (capability revocation and untyped reclamation) region ownership
//! (the builder, not the destroyer). The third capability, the client budget (`WRITE | GRANT`),
//! already carries the same right, so a full logout destroys **the budget before the region**.
//! The order is load-bearing: `crates/regions`' LIFO reclaim returns a freed child's pages only
//! at the watermark top, `mint` splits `region` before `budget`, and the wrong order strands
//! `region`'s pages until [`CONSTRUCTION_UT`] itself goes away (§92 (a caretaker is supervised by the client it serves) names the same rule). A
//! `DESTROY` refused while the caretaker is mid-`forward` to the file service is transient:
//! retry a bounded few times, the `crates/system_initializer::reclaim` idiom
//! (`fixtures/src/login_test_client.rs`'s teardown role is the worked example). A channel nobody
//! finishes connecting has no second party to trigger its destroy and is abandoned (see BUGS).
//!
//! # The terminal: single-session, deny cleanly
//!
//! One interactive boot has one physical terminal, so one session holds it at a time. A login
//! while it is held is refused [`login_protocol::NO_TERMINAL`] **before** its identity and secret
//! are relayed to the credential service (why first: [`serve_login`]'s own comment); the first
//! login to arrive while it is free receives [`TERM_EP`] as its fifth delegated capability, and
//! [`login_protocol::LOGOUT`] releases it. `LOGOUT` authenticates nothing (deliberate for this
//! deployment; `login_protocol`'s BUGS has the hazard a hostile holder of [`REQUEST`] would pose
//! in a different one), and there is no liveness check on the holder: a session that exits,
//! crashes or never calls `LOGOUT` wedges the terminal for the rest of this process's life (no
//! wait-any primitive; notes/hung-component.md's structural bound), and recovery is restarting
//! this process. Real multiplexing is deliberately not built (the roadmap's BUGS recommends
//! against it for the boot this program serves).
//!
//! # Capability contract
//!
//! | slot | what | why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`REQUEST`] | the front door, `RECEIVE` | `CONNECT`/`LOGOUT` only; no page read for either |
//! | [`RESULT`] | `WRITE \| GRANT` | `CONNECTED`, then the private triple; this process keeps its copies, because it serves the login that channel was minted for |
//! | [`VERIFY`] | the credential service's verify endpoint, `WRITE` | the relayed `VERIFY`; the provision endpoint is deleted at both ends before any client exists (`components/src/credentialer.rs`) |
//! | [`FS_EP`] | the file service's root directory, `WRITE \| GRANT` | what every minted caretaker attenuates; where [`listed`] reads the owner's list |
//! | [`FS_PAGE_FRAME`] | the file service's shared page, `WRITE` | `WRITE` alone maps read+write for every holder ([`serve_login`]'s comment); delegated on to each principal |
//! | [`CONSTRUCTION_UT`] | `WRITE \| GRANT` | what channels, caretakers and client budgets are built from; never given away, unlike `root_supervisor`'s |
//! | [`AUDIT`] | `WRITE` | one [`login_protocol::ATTRIBUTED`] per login; **must be drained**, or the first login blocks this process forever (`system_initializer::boot` wires `login_audit_receiver`; the kernel harness drains via `Wiring::audit`) |
//! | [`TERM_EP`] | the interactive terminal, `WRITE \| GRANT` | delegated `WRITE` to the qualifying session; `GRANT` is what lets [`delegate`] narrow and re-delegate it |
//! | [`RUN_UNVOUCHED`] | the progenitor's run-unvouched endpoint, `WRITE \| GRANT`, when placed | delegated `WRITE` only, so presentable and not passable-on (§219 gate D2) |
//! | [`DURABLE_WINDOW`] | one page of the file service's durable window, `WRITE \| GRANT` (milestone 152, Fork 8 D) | the channel a durable session's timetable reads the store through; [`FS_EP`] is badged with the window's number for the two store caretakers ([`open_schedule`]) |
//!
//! Mapped: [`CRED_VA`], the credential page. `login_protocol::CARETAKER_ELF_VA`, read-only, the
//! length in `x0`, holds the caretaker's ELF, and `login_protocol::PROGRAM_MEASUREMENTS_VA`,
//! read-only, the length in `x1`, holds [`measured_boot::PROGRAM_MEASUREMENTS`], so `_start` runs
//! [`measured_boot::verify_in_manifest`] against the same table `crates/system_initializer`
//! checks against; zero length means nothing vouched-for was handed over and every login answers
//! [`login_protocol::DENIED`] (see BUGS). Each minted channel maps one page above
//! [`CONNECT_VA_BASE`], never unmapped or reused in this slice (the channel history in
//! notes/login/ records why). A durable session maps its two timetable images at
//! `login_protocol::USER_TIMETABLE_KEEPER_ELF_VA` and `login_protocol::TIMETABLE_ELF_VA`, the
//! lengths in `x2` ([`login_protocol::schedule_lengths`]), checked against the table above; no
//! job's program travels with them (Fork 8 ruled D by calef 2026-09-27, #1377: a job runs what
//! the live activation generation names), and zero lengths answer `SCHEDULE` as a plain login
//! ([`rederive`]). [`DURABLE_PAGE_VA`] holds the registration page, read-only, while there is
//! one.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-15 (calef, for the whole `login` family: the stem stays on `login`,
//! `login_protocol`, `login_test_client` and the kernel's `login_service` and `login_tests`).
//! Minted 2026-08-22 for milestone 49. The argument and the refused alternatives are in
//! `design/naming/vocabulary-rulings.md`, "The `login` stem stays".
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **One durable session at a time** (milestone 152), at start-up and at a login alike: each
//! costs four capability slots, and [`DURABLE_SESSIONS`] is the fewest of three limits, today all
//! one. The table: `login_protocol::durable::sessions_held` of `abi::CAPABILITY_TABLE_SLOTS`,
//! 24, is one (the durable window's page is held at rest; an ordinary login beside two sessions
//! would need 28; one session leaves no slot spare at a login's peak). The memory:
//! [`DURABLE_UT_PAGES`] holds one budget. The channel: one durable window, and two timetables
//! staging in one page would overwrite each other (Fork 8 D). A second identity asking while
//! another's is durable gets an ordinary session, not a refusal; the start-up pass keeps the
//! first identity in manifest order and leaves the rest to their next login. PR #1360 (open
//! 2026-09-27) raises the table to 32, which derives to three with no edit here; raising the
//! other two takes a window and a budget per session from `crates/system_initializer` and the
//! kernel harness, and a fix for a budget retired out of order leaving a hole (the LIFO rule
//! [`CHANNEL_UT_PAGES`] explains). Counts are from the code, not measured;
//! `notes/durable-delegation/boot-rederivation-in-login.md` has them.
//!
//! **The durable window is shared by a session's two caretakers and its timetable**, and nothing
//! else; sound as window 0 is (the timetable is the only client, every request a blocking
//! `CALL`).
//!
//! **Start-up waits on each re-derived session's timetable**: [`rederive`] restores each stored
//! document before the front door opens, [`Durable::restore`] waiting up to [`END_WAIT_SECS`]
//! per session; the usual wait has never been measured, in the suite or on a board.
//!
//! **`LOGIN_CONSTRUCTION_PAGES` must hold a durable budget**: `_start` splits [`OWN_UT_PAGES`],
//! [`DURABLE_UT_PAGES`] and [`CHANNEL_UT_PAGES`] before serving anyone, and a budget short of
//! them stops this process at `fail(2)`. `crates/system_initializer` and the kernel harness
//! derive the figure from `login_protocol::durable::BUDGET_PAGES`.
//!
//! **A `user_timetable_keeper` that fails half way leaves what it split off** a child of the
//! user's budget, which then never comes down ([`open_schedule`] reclaims the keeper's own
//! region on failure); only a build out of room can do it, and this suite's build is sized not
//! to.
//!
//! **`SUSPEND` does nothing while a session holds the terminal** (reading the suspended list
//! borrows the file page that session's caretaker shares, so it waits): the cascade runs at the
//! suspended identity's next login, ending its durable session before refusing it, so a
//! suspended user's scheduled jobs can run on. A page of this process's own would close it.
//!
//! **Ending a durable session waits for a running job to finish** (§222 (who holds a user's schedule): the timetable is the
//! only process that can name its jobs' regions, and has to let a job finish; a job that never
//! finishes keeps the session past [`END_WAIT_SECS`], and `SUSPEND` then answers that it ended
//! nothing). Ending one outright needs a timetable operation that destroys its jobs or a kernel
//! way to revoke a whole region subtree (§40 (a supervisor's death is its subtree's death)'s first caveat); both are architect's calls.
//!
//! **A durable session nobody logs back into is never retired**: retirement happens at that
//! identity's next login, when the exit word says the timetable has stopped; until then the
//! stopped session's region and budget stay in [`DURABLE_UT_PAGES`]'s budget.
//!
//! **An identity longer than `filesystem_protocol::grant::MAX_NAME` (16 bytes) cannot get a
//! per-identity subtree in this slice**, though `login_protocol::MAX_IDENTITY` (64 bytes) would
//! accept it: the grant name travels in two `START` argument words, not a frame, and [`mint`]
//! refuses rather than truncate a name that two identities sharing their first 16 bytes would
//! silently share. Lifting it means a frame for the grant, a change to
//! `filesystem_protocol::grant`'s contract and every caretaker built against it.
//!
//! **This program spells measured boot's load-or-refuse decision itself** ([`_start`] runs
//! [`measured_boot::verify_in_manifest`] and folds absent, refused and not-an-ELF into `None`)
//! rather than calling `measured_boot::verdict`, which milestone 246 (measured boot's refusal path is tested by nothing) moved the same decision
//! into a crate for: switching buys the tested refusal branch at the cost of a `Verdict` whose
//! `unvouched` field this program has nothing to do with; not done, on the record, because it is
//! a boot path this lane was not gating. The check's trust root is the progenitor's hand-over
//! (bytes and table arrive already verified there), so it is a consistency check, kept because
//! it costs one hash and catches a spawner that pairs the wrong two blobs.
//!
//! **The audit endpoint proves establishment, not per-request attribution** (§109 names both
//! halves; this program is the first): no server in this tree needs the second, and wiring it
//! into a real multi-tenant consumer is follow-on for whenever one exists.
//!
//! **Not wired into the interactive boot**: still spawned by the kernel's guest test harness
//! (`kernel/src/user/login_service.rs`), not reachable from `crates/system_initializer::boot`'s
//! prompt. The device-grant half of the blocker is built (the virtio-rng grant chain, §120 (a QEMU-only virtio-rng stopgap for the interactive boot)'s
//! amendment); the remaining pieces (wiring `credentialer` and this program into `boot`, a real
//! provisioned subtree and credential, and where the demo credential's password comes from, an
//! open fork) live in `design/roadmap/0049-users-and-attribution.md`'s BUGS, being facts about
//! the boot's wiring, not this program's contract.
