//! **`terminal_supervisor`: holds the line editor, and replaces it live** (milestone 23 (a
//! capability-routed component OS with live replacement); calef's ruling of 2026-09-27, option A of
//! `design/roadmap/661-a-terminal-supervisor-holds-the-line-editor.md`).
//!
//! `system_initializer` used to build `line_editor` itself and then give away every terminal
//! capability it held, so nothing on a running system could replace the terminal. Now it builds
//! this instead and hands it the objects a `line_editor` is made of, plus a budget for two
//! instances. This program builds `line_editor` from the declaration in `line_editor::component`,
//! keeps its endowment, its control endpoint and its handoff page, and runs the swap of DECISIONS
//! §209 (state handoff is an opaque blob over a granted frame, and it is optional) when asked:
//!
//! ```text
//!   1 BUILT      lay the replacement out, wired from the same declaration, not started.
//!   2 QUIESCED   CALL OP_QUIESCE on the terminal endpoint. Its FIFO drains everything ahead; a
//!                parked reader is answered FLAG_RETRY and asks again; the blob is written.
//!   3 ABSORBING  start the replacement with START_ABSORB. It reads the blob before it serves.
//!   4 COMMIT     NOTE_ABSORBED: tell the incumbent CTL_QUIT and collect it.
//!     or UNDO    NOTE_REFUSED: collect the refuser and tell the incumbent CTL_RESUME.
//! ```
//!
//! It is `swapper`'s shape, an unprivileged operator holding exactly the objects it swaps, pointed
//! at a component a person uses. The two control endpoints alternate, so a word meant for the
//! incumbent can never reach its replacement.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **Nothing on a real boot asks it to swap.** The trigger is milestone 198 (a package manager, and the trivial install)'s installer activating a
//! new `line_editor` build, and that message is not built; `system_initializer` passes no swap
//! endpoint, so the supervisor builds the terminal and then waits on its supervision endpoint. The
//! kernel's guest test holds the swap endpoint and is the only thing that swaps today.
//!
//! **A replacement is the same image.** The supervisor was handed one `line_editor` image, and the
//! request carries none. A new build arriving with the trigger is the trigger's design, above.
//!
//! **A `line_editor` that faults is not restarted.** Its death is collected at the next swap, and
//! until then the terminal is gone. Restarting it fresh is kill-and-replace, which this program
//! could do, and is not built because nothing has asked for it.
//!
//! Name: provisional, minted 2026-09-27 by the lane for milestone 23. calef's to name.
