//! **The JH7110 Ethernet port's data plane inside `net_stack`** (milestone 53 (the board's own
//! peripherals: network and storage on real silicon); notes/designware-ethernet.md).
//!
//! `e1000e_transport.rs`'s shape for radon: the volatile shell around
//! `crates/designware_ethernet`'s [`DataPlane`], which is two windows and a barrier. The ring
//! logic, the descriptor formats and the judgment of every word the device writes are in the
//! crate, host-tested against a simulated controller. The kernel already brought the port up,
//! measured that its DMA is coherent, and started both channels with nothing available
//! (`kernel/src/designware_ethernet.rs`); what is mapped here, and what is not, is
//! `kernel/src/user/designware_ethernet_service.rs`'s header.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Polled**, every `e1000e_transport::POLL_MS` (`net_stack`'s `poll_without_interrupt` serves
//!   both), for `e1000e_transport`'s reason: no interrupt is granted.
//! - **A full transmit ring drops the frame** after a bounded wait; the stack above retransmits.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 53's lane, 2026-10-06 UTC), `<device>_transport` after
//! `e1000e_transport`, with `designware_ethernet` the crate's own provisional name.
