//! **The queue broker: the latency ladder's middle rung** (milestone 23, DECISIONS §41).
//!
//! The default rung has no process in it at all: a client CALLs a stable endpoint, whoever is
//! parked in `RECEIVE_CAP` on it answers, and a swap changes who that is. That costs nothing, and it
//! is what `swapper`'s direct system uses. It has one property a producer may not be able to live
//! with: while nobody is receiving, a caller **blocks**. Its request is safe (it parks on the
//! endpoint's own sender queue and the next server drains it), but the caller is stopped until then.
//!
//! This program is the answer for a channel that cannot afford that. It stands between a producer
//! and a backend and takes custody of requests while the backend is away, so the producer's call
//! always returns:
//!
//! ```text
//!   steady state (backend up)      producer --CALL--> broker --CALL--> backend
//!                                                            <--reply--
//!                                           <--reply--                      2 round trips
//!
//!   down window (backend gone)     producer --CALL--> broker  [enqueue]
//!                                           <-ACCEPTED-                     1 round trip, no block
//! ```
//!
//! **The tax is real and it is why this is opt-in.** Interposing a process turns one rendezvous
//! into two, and the kernel-side `broker_rtt` benchmark prices it against `call_reply` (the same
//! client and backend with nothing in between). Direct synchronous rendezvous stays the fast path;
//! this rung is chosen per channel, for channels that cross a lifecycle boundary.
//!
//! **The buffer is this process's own memory, and it is bounded.** The kernel does not grow: it
//! keeps synchronous rendezvous with no allocation, and the queue is userspace policy in a
//! userspace `.bss`, inside the region this instance was built in. A runaway producer fills it and
//! gets [`QUEUE_FULL`](swap_protocol::QUEUE_FULL) back, which is backpressure as a value the producer can
//! read rather than a policy hidden inside a server.
//!
//! **What it does not do**, stated so the ladder's top rung is not implied: it does not write to
//! storage, so it does not survive its own crash. That is the durable rung, and it is not built.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-07-30 (calef, DECISIONS §39, landed by milestone 46), replacing `brokerd`.
//! Refused `brokerd` (the `-d` suffix claims the Unix process model DECISIONS §39 rejects, before a
//! reader has seen a line of code; that model is defined by the ambient authority this OS
//! deliberately lacks).
