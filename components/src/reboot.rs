//! **`reboot`**: restart the machine (milestone 805 (`reboot` at the prompt), DECISIONS §251
//! (restarting the machine is a kernel object the progenitor hands out)).
//!
//! The whole program is: sync the writable filesystem, say what the sync answered, then invoke
//! the reboot object. On success the last step never returns, and the next thing on the console is
//! the firmware.
//!
//! # The capability table
//!
//! | slot | what | why it is that and not wider |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | the output sink, `WRITE` | where the sync report goes |
//! | 8 | the diagnostics sink, `WRITE` | where a refusal goes, so `>` cannot swallow it |
//! | 13 | the reboot object, `WRITE` | the right to invoke it, and no `GRANT` to hand it on |
//! | 14 | the file server, sync-only, `WRITE` | `SYNC` and nothing else; empty with no filesystem |
//!
//! # Why a sync-only capability
//!
//! §251's clause 3 says the sync comes before the reset, and the kernel does none of it. `SYNC`
//! needs `dir::WRITE` on a handle for an ordinary client, which is also the right to open and
//! truncate files by name. So the file server binds this program's badge sync-only
//! (`filesystem_protocol::fs::BIND_SYNC`): it answers `SYNC` and refuses every other verb, and
//! nothing here can reach a file. calef ruled against the progenitor syncing on this program's
//! behalf (2026-10-06 UTC, #1783), so the sync is this program's own act.
//!
//! # Why the report is sent twice
//!
//! The report goes to the shell, which forwards it to the terminal, and the reset that follows
//! stops everything. A `SEND` on a rendezvous returns when the receiver has taken the message, not
//! when it has printed it, so the end-of-stream after the report is the barrier: the shell takes it
//! only once it has finished with the report. Without that the report raced the reset and lost.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A firmware that accepts the reset and hangs cannot be told from a slow one**, from inside
//!   the machine. radon did exactly that on 2026-09-04, and milestone 592 (radon's cold reboot dies
//!   in OpenSBI's PMIC write) holds the fix, which has not run on the board. On radon today this
//!   program prints its report and the board stops.
//! - **A refusal does not exit non-zero**, because no program in this system reports an exit
//!   status (`crates/swish`'s `Status` says so). The refusal is a sentence on the second stream,
//!   naming which of the kernel's four reasons it was.
//! - **The sync is not fenced against background jobs.** A write another job makes after this
//!   program's `SYNC` is answered and before the reset lands is not covered: the window is the
//!   report's two sends and the invoke. The shell runs `reboot` in the foreground, so this is a job
//!   somebody started earlier and left writing. Milestone 853 (orderly shutdown closes the sync
//!   window) owns closing it.
//! - **Devices are not quiesced.** A DMA transfer in flight is cut off; after `SYNC` the block
//!   servers are idle and nothing else writes to persistent storage.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 805). A verb, which design/naming.md passes only as a term of art.
