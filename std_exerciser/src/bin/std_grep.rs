//! **`std_grep`: the smallest `std` program that reads what its words name** (milestone 205 (how
//! a foreign program is told what to do), §170 (how a foreign program is told what to do) clauses
//! 2 to 5). `std_grep NEEDLE [PATH...]` prints every line of every file under the paths that
//! contains NEEDLE, as `path:line`, walking a directory the way `rg` does. With no path it searches `.`, as `rg` does.
//!
//! It exists because `rg` cannot travel as an image yet (256 KiB, `spawnproto::IMAGE_MAX_PAGES`)
//! and is not built in CI, and the designation half needs a program that behaves like it at the
//! prompt. `script/swish-check` copies it to the disk unvouched and runs it by path, so every
//! name it opens was designated by a word on the line and granted read-only, and nothing else
//! exists for it (calef's N1 ruling, 2026-09-27T06:27Z: `std_grep needle` names nothing and is
//! granted nothing, so its search of `.` fails, loudly).
//!
//! Exit status is `grep`'s: 0 for a match, 1 for none, 2 for an error. Name: provisional
//! (2026-09-27).
