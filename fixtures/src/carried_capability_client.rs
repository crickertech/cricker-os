//! **A client that receives a capability in a reply** (§255 (each socket is its own capability),
//! milestone 649 (every client of a network stack shares its socket numbers)). The other half of
//! `carried_capability_server`.
//!
//! - slot 0: the server's request endpoint (`WRITE`)
//! - slot 1: the report endpoint (`WRITE`)
//!
//! It `CALL`s, and the reply must carry a capability; it sends a word on that capability, which
//! only works if the capability names the server's probe endpoint. It `CALL`s again, and that
//! plain reply must carry none.
//!
//! Report: one word of bits. Bit 0, the first reply carried a capability; bit 1, the send on it
//! succeeded; bit 2, the second reply carried none; bit 3, the carried slot was not one of the two
//! this process was spawned with.
//!
//! Name: provisional (lane/649-sockets-are-capabilities, 2026-10-07 UTC).
