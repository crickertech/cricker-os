//! **A builder that builds more than its scratch window holds, and keeps building** (milestone 604
//! (provisional), the builder's scratch cursor is bounded).
//!
//! Holds a memory region to build children from (slot 0), a report endpoint (slot 1), and a second,
//! 48-page region that pays for its own page tables (slot 2). It forges a `ripgrep`-sized ELF,
//! 668 pages of image, the span milestone 121 (ripgrep on nife) measured, and builds a child from it
//! with `supervision_protocol::build_child_space` [`BUILDS`] times, each out of a region of its own
//! that it destroys before the next. It never starts a child: what is under test is the builder's
//! own address space, not the child's.
//!
//! **What it proves.** Every page the loader fills is mapped once in the builder's own scratch
//! window, and there is no unmap. The window is taken back only because destroying the child's
//! region revokes every mapping of its pages, the builder's included (DECISIONS §13 (frame
//! revocation)). [`BUILDS`] builds put 73,480 pages through the window, more than the 65,536 that
//! lay between the progenitor's old cursor and its initrd window, which is about a hundred spawns of
//! `ripgrep`. So they pass only if the loader reuses the pages the kernel gave back.
//!
//! **And the negative control is built in.** The builder's own page tables come out of slot 2, 48
//! pages, which covers the window's 32 last-level tables and the one or two above them. The old
//! cursor, which never came back, needed a new table every 512 pages, 144 for this run. Measured
//! on aarch64 on 2026-09-26 with the loader's wrap taken out: 36 builds, 24,048 scratch pages, and
//! the 37th refused. So this is not a test that passes by having room to spare.
//!
//! Reports `(builds, pages, window_pages)` once, then exits: the builds that succeeded, the scratch
//! pages they used between them, and the window's own size, so the kernel's test can check the run
//! went round the window more than once without knowing this crate's numbers.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 604).

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
