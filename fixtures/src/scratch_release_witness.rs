//! **A builder that gives its scratch window back, and then reaches for it** (milestone 95 (an
//! unmap primitive, and the mappings init never lets go), §249 (a running address space stays
//! nameable)).
//!
//! Holds a memory region to build a child from (slot 0, which the child is built straight out of), a report endpoint (slot 1), a small region
//! that pays for its own page tables (slot 2), and, in one of the two runs the kernel's test makes,
//! a `WRITE` capability to its own address space (slot 3), which is how the kernel endows the
//! progenitor at slot 28. It builds one child with `supervision_protocol::build_child`, the code
//! path the progenitor builds every boot server with, and then writes to the first page of its own
//! scratch window, which is where the loader filled the child's first page.
//!
//! **What the two runs prove together.** With slot 3, the loader gave that page up with `UNMAP` as
//! soon as it was in the child, so the write faults and the second report never comes: that is the
//! negative control milestone 95's block names, a builder writing to a page it built for a child and
//! faulting. Without slot 3, the same write lands and the second report arrives, which is the
//! window the progenitor held onto every boot server's memory until now. The second run is what
//! keeps the first from passing for the wrong reason (a write that faulted because nothing was
//! ever mapped there).
//!
//! Reports `(1, va, 0)` once the child is built, `va` being the scratch page it is about to write,
//! and `(2, va, 0)` only if the write landed; on a failed build, `(9, 0, 0)`. The kernel's test
//! (`system_tests`' `running_space_tests`) mirrors these three words, as `authority_tests` mirrors
//! `root_supervisor`'s.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 95's §249 lane, 2026-10-05 UTC).
