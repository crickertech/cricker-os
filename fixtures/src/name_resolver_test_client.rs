//! **A client of the name resolver, and nothing more** (milestone 384 (in a capability system the
//! resolver is a grant)).
//!
//! It asks the resolver about every name in `name_resolution_protocol::fixture::CASES`, in order,
//! and reports each reply as it gets it; the kernel's test judges them
//! (`system_tests/src/user/name_resolver_tests.rs`). Then, given a network, it connects to the
//! address the first name resolved to and checks an echo comes back: a name it did not know the
//! address of, carried to a connection, which is what resolving it was for.
//!
//! It is the shape milestone 801 (packages over the internet)'s package client will have: a badged
//! capability to a resolver that answers for one zone, a capability to the stack, and no way to look
//! up anything outside the zone whatever its code does.
//!
//! # What it holds
//!
//! | slot | what | rights |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | its report endpoint | `WRITE` |
//! | 1 | the resolver's endpoint, badged by the spawner | `WRITE` |
//! | 2 | an untyped budget: its resolver page and its socket page | |
//! | 3 | `net_stack`'s `Stack` endpoint, when `arg0` is `fixture::WITH_NETWORK` | `WRITE` |
//!
//! # What it reports
//!
//! One message per case, `(case index, the reply's outcome word, the first address)`, then
//! `(CASES.len(), echo verdict, 0)`. The address is packed big-endian, as
//! `name_resolution_protocol::endowment::server` packs one.
//!
//! Name: provisional 2026-10-06 (UTC), milestone 384's lane, on the `*_test_client` pattern
//! (`fs_test_client`, `login_test_client`).
