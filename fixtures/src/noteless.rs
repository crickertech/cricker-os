//! **A packaged program with no manifest note** (milestone 47 (navigation and naming)'s bare-name
//! lane, 2026-09-27).
//!
//! It prints one line and exits. It exists because DECISIONS §229 (how a bare name at the prompt
//! reaches an installed program), as calef ruled it on 2026-09-27, refuses to install a package
//! whose program has a name the image carries, and
//! `script/swish-check` had been installing `uptime`, which every image carries, to prove the
//! installed path and the no-note default. This takes over both: like `greeting` it is listed in
//! `fixtures`' `packaged_only`, so no archive packs it and only its package
//! (`packages/noteless.recipe.toml`) puts it on a machine; unlike `greeting` it carries no ELF
//! note, so a vouched copy is bound and endowed as `grant_plan::NO_NOTE_MANIFEST`, its output
//! alone.
//!
//! ```text
//! $ package install downloads/noteless.nifepkg
//!   installed; generation 1 is live
//! $ noteless
//! noteless: installed, and carrying no manifest note
//! ```
//!
//! # What this program holds
//!
//! Slot 0, its output: the sink contract (`crates/byte_sink_protocol`). Nothing else, which is the
//! no-note default and the thing the gate's `caps` line checks.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! It proves the path and the default, and nothing about the program.
//!
//! Name: provisional (2026-09-27). Says the one thing that distinguishes it from `greeting`.
